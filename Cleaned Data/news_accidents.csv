87,Stranger at a Car Accident in India,,"[""(Obligatory 'first post here, mobile formatting, etc' note)"", ""So this was 2-3 years ago in India, and my father and I were driving home from a wedding. I don't know how much y'all know about weddings over there, but this was a 3 day event that involved the entirety of two middle-of-nowhere-nothing villages...it was a huge deal. And we were the only white people the majority of these folks had ever seen, so beyond the bride and groom themselves, we were The Best Guests."", ""This meant near constant attention, no relaxation or any time to ourselves, and 'sleep' came in the form of a concrete slab of a bed with a thin blanket over it, nestled snuggly in between apparently every drunk uncle the village could hold, all passionately arguing for hours about SOMETHING in Hindi. I think it was maybe the music, which also constantly blared from concert-sized speakers through the whole village. It was safe to say by the time we left the wedding we were already extremely sleep deprived and out of it. This isn't even the fun part though."", ""Through an odd chain of events that isn't totally related to this story, while driving home on the single-lane road that had traffic in both directions, dodging donkey carts, groups of scooters, and other drivers at about 120kph (72mph for us Freedom Unit-ers out there), we get in a head-on collision."", 'I remember realizing what was going to happen a few seconds before it did. Closing my eyes, loosening my body, making sure my tongue would be ok and then-BAM. The world turned upside down. And then again. And again. And one more time.', 'Our car flipped four times, landing upside down in an overgrown field near the spot of the accident. The other car was mostly gone, and what was left of it was still on the road.', 'Glass was everywhere, my dad was unconscious, my lehenga was ripped to shreds, and there were suddenly voices all around me. I remember being extremely confused and dazed. And I hurt. Why did I hurt?', ""Dozens of people had apparently stopped to flip the car back over to help The American Tourists out. A few people pulled me out through the left-hand broken window and immediately went back in to help my father on the driver's side. I, extremely confused, exhausted, and scared, most likely concussed (I later found out definitely concussed), wandered over to the road and the other demolished car. I could hear a siren in the distance. An ambulance? Cops? I didn't pay attention. Where were my shoes?"", 'Suddenly a man had his arms around my shoulders and was ushering me to an unknown white car a small distance from the wreck. ""I will take you to the hospital"" he said. I asked where my father was and a few other questions. He mostly ignored me.', '""He is fine, come on""', 'He pushed me forward, and in a daze I followed, asking about my things, my shoes, my dad. All I had was my phone, which was still in a death grip in my hand. He ignored me.', '""Do not worry. Hurry, get in the car""', ""I did as I was told, though I remember asking a few more times about my shoes. I was barefoot and limping. I remember being focused on my right foot, how it wouldn't work, basically ignoring the guy guiding me away from the accident and the rest of the people. Why did it hurt so much? And where was my bag? The man urged me forward some more, making promising that my things were fine, he had them already, just get in the car. I was barely paying attention, slowly following. Where was my dad?"", ""At that point I guess the man decided I wasn't moving fast enough. He wrenched my phone from my hand, maneuvered me into the back seat, and slammed the door behind me. He was walking around to the driver's side when an ambulance pulled up. I struggled with the door, saying I'll get into the ambulance instead, that my dad must be there. And where were my things?"", '""NO."" He slammed the door again, locking it this time. ""BE QUIET."" At this point I started crying and was still confusedly trying to open the locked door, blubbering that I needed my things. He insisted he was helping and to shut up. shut up. shut up.', ""He rushed around, opened the driver's side door and was about to get in when I heard an almost roar-like sound errupt to my left. Suddenly my father was there, bleeding, limping, ignoring the chaos all around us, and angrier than I've ever seen him."", '""GET MY FUCKING DAUGHTER OUT OF YOUR FUCKING CAR.""', 'He grabbed the man (who was halfway in the vehicle at that point) and threw him to the ground, unlocked the backseat door and rushed around to pull me out.', '""Dad where are my shoes...does he still have my phone?"" I obliviously asked to thin air, as my father was already back a few feet away shouting, hands around the man\'s throat, demanding my phone. With a terrified look the man pulled it out of his pocket and threw it several feet away, causing my dad to drop him on the pavement in oneswift motion and bound after the device.', 'At that point the man hurriedly climbed into his car and sped away while I made my way to the back of the waiting ambulance, still not really processing what just happened. My dad materialized on the bench next to me a few seconds later, my cracked phone in hand, and enveloped me in a huge hug while saying how scared he was, the paramedics moving all around us,  securing everything and preparing for the drive to the hospital.', ""Everything after that is a story for another time, but to the random Indian man who most likely tried to abduct me from the accident, let's not meet again.""]",https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/cgjq1z/stranger_at_a_car_accident_in_india/

237,'I have a fascination for violence of all sorts' - Anurag Kashyap | 2014,,"['Anurag Kashyap recently attended the New York Indian Film Festival, where his film ', ' was premiered.', ' has dark and violent tones, and deals with the kidnapping of a little girl in Mumbai.', 'Kashyap has delayed the release of the film in India after he filed a lawsuit against the Indian censor board for their rule that requires all films to carry anti-smoking messages.', ' follows the similar track of Kashyap‚Äôs works - from the early films (', ', where he wrote the script and ', ', which he directed) to his five-plus-hour long magnum opus ', ' - large ensemble cast of relatively unknown actors who play realistic, brutal characters.', 'I don‚Äôt know, because when there is actual violence in front of me, I can‚Äôt see it.', 'I saw one accident and I fainted. I was 19 then.', 'It‚Äôs not that I enjoy it. I have a fascination for violence of all sorts, not just physical violence. If you look at it carefully, baring a few scenes in ', ', in all of my other films, the violence is always off screen.', 'You are tempted to violate the audience watching the film. That‚Äôs why I show off-screen violence because people need to wake up. They need to be drawn in. They are very happy and content with the way things happen in the expected way.', 'Earlier this evening, I was listening to a discussion after the screening of ', ' (National Award winning Marathi film), and one person was saying that she didn‚Äôt want the young boy to be beaten up. He had all this rage and we knew someone was going to beat him up. The film ends with a moment where you do not see the rest of the action. That‚Äôs the most effective way of using violence.', 'A lot of people think violence is strong in my movies, but they aren‚Äôt actually seeing it. Even the beheading scene in ', ' is not there. The camera is behind the person and all you see are his hands moving. The imagination makes the audience think they actually saw the beheading and they are completely shaken by it.', 'I choreograph all my violence scenes and try and do long takes. I try not to use it as a gimmick, where you cheat. Otherwise, the edits make it look exciting.', 'He‚Äôs actually like a child and his dream project, which he is making now - ', ' - is about a missionary who is persecuted in Taiwan. Scorsese was that kid on the block who would run away from violence.', 'And he would hide in the church. People, who participate in violence, usually go see a comedy film. Only a guy, who watches it from a distance and is so bothered by it, would be the one to recreate it.', 'The next film that I am writing is a very emotional one, a simple story about a father and a daughter.', 'There hasn‚Äôt been a single time when our society or the world hasn‚Äôt been violent. It was always like that. Centuries ago, it was far worse. But we live in denial and I think sometimes it is important to address it in a serious way.', 'When the mob collects, they always beat up the weakest. Each individual in the mob, his or her individual rage is coming from somewhere else. It is the same rage that brought people to the streets against the anti-corruption movement.', 'Yet, it‚Äôs a fact that no one in India will stand in a line. We protest against corruption, yet everyone wants someone inside. India is the only country where people ask me how I got into the movies, whether I knew someone. Where does that question come from? No one wants to take the hard way.', 'And then we become so moralistic about the world. We are the second most populated country in the world and we have such a problem with sex. We are a strange bunch of people.', 'When it is black and white, and good will win over evil.', 'But the moment there are situations in gray, people get bothered by it. So whether it is Bhiku Mhatre or Bhau (characters in Ram Gopal Varma‚Äôs ', '), each of them is vulnerable and has a darker side. Every character is good and bad as well. As an audience, you can‚Äôt take sides and you get very uncomfortable with that.', 'It was a very simple approach. We were making a film about a business household, where the owner of the company is Bhau and people working for him are like Bhiku Mhatre. It‚Äôs just that their business is extortion and murder, and the people are from the streets.', 'Otherwise, they are normal people, with homes and families. What Bhiku does is to go to work everyday and then return home. His work makes him a criminal but we approached the characters like normal people.', 'What they chose to do for their profession, I would not have the courage to do. But they made their choice out of desperation, frustration or just because of kinks.', 'We didn‚Äôt have to research the psychology of a gangster because it is very similar to anybody else. A gangster goes for his first kill just the same way as a banker goes to collect investment money from someone for the first time.', 'It is believable because it was completely improvised. It‚Äôs like the police station scene in ', ' (at the beginning of the film). It was not written. I went and told each of the actors their motivations. You have to see the first single shot we took. It went on for 14 and half minutes. Eventually, I took different shots, as I couldn‚Äôt have the scene go on for that long.', 'I don‚Äôt think I am child of Tarantino. I am a child of Scorsese, who fantasizes about Tarantino.', 'But there is a new generation - I call them the generation of Torrents. They have no money in their pocket but they want access to world cinema, which our country and distributors would never release. And Torrents gave them access to it.', 'Go down to Tamil Nadu and see the incredible movies being made there. Also, in Marathi cinema. And this generation is changing cinema. That is also happening in Hindi films now.', 'And Tarantino wasn‚Äôt the only one making violent films. They started watching Korean, Chinese and Hong Kong films.', 'There is more Indian story telling in regional cinema. What Marathi cinema is doing is the real India.', 'What Tamil cinema is doing, portions of it are hard to deal with. When you see Vetrimaaran or Subramaniapuram, they are talking about a South India, which is obsessed with cinema. At the same time, they have violence in their everyday life. And they are rooted there because they have to use their language.', 'It‚Äôs different with Hindi films because that cinema has become more urban and most of the Hindi filmmakers write in English. So their films tend to be more westernised, barring a Tigmanshu Dhulia, who is very rooted.', 'Also, unlike the Hindi filmmakers, the Tamil directors are not aware of an international audience. They only care about the local audience. Hindi filmmakers want to reach out to a larger audience and so they may have a western way of story telling.', 'I see all kinds of films. I saw ', ' and ', '.', 'It‚Äôs based on the story.', 'The man was killed with 700 bullets and when the police came to pick up the body, the hand just came off. They had to eventually pick up the body with shovels. They refused to do post-mortem on the body.', 'Even Manoj Bajpayi‚Äôs killing in the first part, he was at a petrol station. Munawar Khan was shot just like that, and he went on a rickshaw with a bullet in his head. He died in the rickshaw. And it happened in a marketplace. So it was all a recreation of what actually happened.', 'I just made it more dramatic and cinematic.', 'That is actually more violent. Because the human mind is more imaginative and darker than what we see on the screen.', 'And people are bothered by their own possibilities.']",https://www.reddit.com/r/BollyBlindsNGossip/comments/oyl2kn/i_have_a_fascination_for_violence_of_all_sorts/

Everyone just shits on Indian men, this is being done on a very very large scale. My hypothesis is that most of the west thinks that India is the worst place for women and Indian men are bad misogynists and oppressors.. This is just too much and to be honest very disturbing for me myself as an Indian male. I am pretty sure similar is the case with my other fellow Indian brothers too.', 'Well let\'s look into the case on how Indian men live and what are their ""privileges""', 'Indian Constitution does not have any explicit provision regarding the right to food, the fundamental right to life enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution may be interpreted to include the right to live with human dignity, which may include the right to food and other basic necessities.', 'But we have an act named as ""National Food Security Act, (NFSA) 2013"" The enactment of the National Food Security Act, (NFSA) 2013 on July 5, 2013 marks a paradigm shift in the approach to food security from welfare to rights based approach. The Act legally entitled upto 75% of the rural population and 50% of the urban population to receive subsidized food grains under Targeted Public Distribution System.The Act is being implemented in all the States/UTs, and on an all India basis, out of maximum coverage of 8.134 million persons, around 8 million persons have been covered under NFSA at present for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains.', 'Now this act creates absolute matriarchy in the household it covers the:  Eldest woman of the household of age 18 years or above is mandated to be the head of the household for the purpose of issuing of ration cards under the Act.', 'According to ""National Policy for Women 2016""', 'Nutritious and safe food through Public Distribution System (PDS) for households', 'especially the unreached women and children with high nutritional vulnerabilities as envisaged in National Food Security Act, 2013 will be made available. Management of institutions of food/grain banks by women Groups (SHGs) could be considered to enable uninterrupted supply of food grains even in times of natural/man-made calamities or disasters such as flood, drought etc. So this system will be controlled by women only..', 'Improving the nutrition and health status of adolescent girls will be accorded special focus.

After divorce : Well, No Rights. Get ready to share your half of the assets and properties with your wife as per respective religious laws. Even if your wife is working, Section 125 of CRPC requires a wife to live at the same standards which she maintained during her marriage with the husband. So you might end up paying maintenance.

The quantum and type of necessities covered within the scope of maintenance may vary, depending on the status, financial position and number of dependents, etc and is at the discretion of the court. Prior to passing an order under Section 125, the court does take cognizance of the amount of maintenance already ordered under the personal law. The reasoning is based on the premise that the wife is entitled to live as per the standard and status of her husband. Males can\'t adopt female children but females can adopt male children. Other rights like Domestic Violence and 498a are already mentioned. Men‚Äôs rights to maintenance can vary under different Acts. Under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (As I mentioned it\'s for men to get maintenance as wive\'s living standards at marriage time are to be maintained) both husband and wife can claim maintenance, while only the woman can do so under the Special Marriage Act, 1954.Under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, the wife has to be paid maintenance in the iddat period and mehr has to be returned (Under Section 3 of the MWA, a Muslim husband is obligated to pay maintenance to his divorced wife within the iddat period. This provision has, in the past, been misinterpreted to mean that the husband is legally obligated to maintain his wife only ""during"" the iddat period. However, the Supreme Court in the landmark case of Daniel Latiffi v. Union of India14 has clarified that the maintenance payable by the husband to his wife during the iddat period covers the time period beyond the iddat period as well) . Christians: Under Section 37 of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, the divorced wife can get maintenance for life by applying in a civil or a high court.The Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936, makes the husband liable to pay maintenance to wife for life if she remains unmarried after divorce, and can get a maximum of one-fifth of his net income.Further, in Lalita Toppo v. The State of Jharkhand, the Supreme Court has recognised the right of a woman in a live-in relationship to claim maintenance from her partner under the PWDA.(Protection of Women From Domestic Violence act)', 'More about muslim women Earlier, a Muslim woman could claim maintenance only under the Muslim personal law as laid down in the Quran under which a husband was liable to pay maintenance to his wife only during the period of \'iddat\'. However, the Supreme Court has, vide its landmark judgment in the Shah Bano case12 held that a Muslim woman is entitled to claim maintenance under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 irrespective of Muslim personal law. In this regard, it is pertinent to note that immediately after the Shah Bano verdict, the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 (""MWA"") was enacted whereunder inter alia a Muslim woman is entitled to claim from her husband (i) a reasonable and fair provision and maintenance; (ii) an amount equal to the sum of mahr or dower agreed to be paid to her at the time of her marriage or at any time thereafter according to Muslim law; (iii) all the properties given to her before or at the time of marriage or after her marriage by her relatives or friends or her husband or any relatives of the husband or his friends; and (iv) in cases where the divorced woman herself maintains the children born to her before or after her divorce, a reasonable and fair provision and maintenance for a period of two years from the respective dates of birth of such children.', 'Also recently Uttarakhand state ', ' an ordinance to give co-ownership rights to women in their husband‚Äôs ancestral property', 'Read some High court statements like', 'and this ', ' too', 'Now other act named Public Safety Act The Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act, 1978 (PSA) is a preventive detention law under which a person is taken into custody to prevent them from acting harmfully against ""the security of the state or the maintenance of the public order\' in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir (now a union territory).The PSA violates international human rights law and standards by providing for detention without trial while denying the possibility of judicial review and other safeguards for those in detention required under international human rights law. During PSA detention, the detainee can be lodged in any suitable prison or subsidiary jail (such as a house) in India without any warrant, trial, or court hearing for a maximum of one or two years.In 2015 the government made public the figure of 16,329 persons having been detained under the act since 1988, nearly all from Kashmir.

Women have also traditionally not been a significant part of the armed groups. Although women take part in protests against the authorities, the police and security forces do certainly think twice about arresting or detaining women, as they know that this has the possibility of stirring trouble and bringing attention to themselves. Unfortunately this has not stopped women from continuing to face other human rights violations, particularly rape and other forms of sexual assault.‚Äù' Can you see the male disposability here? It's very much clear. Attention will come if women will be detained but is not coming when men are being mistreated at regular basis.

There are various reasons for under-reporting, but foremost among them are our social system and values attached to men, which stop them from sharing and reporting domestic violence and abuse. Even when men report domestic abuse and violence, most people do not believe them. When men try to narrate their problems, torture, struggle, and harassment within marriage and family, no one listens to them; instead, people laugh at them. Many men are ashamed of talking about and sharing that they are beaten by their wives (Sarkar, Dsouza,& Dasgupta, 2007).One needs to understand that dynamics of domestic violence and abuse among men and women are different, and reasons, purposes, and motives are often very different. There are various studies on dynamics of violence against women, but there are limited studies on the issue of domestic violence and abuse against men. The study by Save Family Foundation (Sarkar et al., 2007), which interviewed 1,650 husbands between the ages of 15 and 49 years, selected through random sampling using a schedule adapted from the WHO multicountry study on husband‚Äôs health and domestic violence, reports that economical violence (32.8%) is common, followed by emotional violence (22.2%), physical violence (25.2%), and sexual violence (17.7%). The study shows that the probability of violence increased significantly with the duration of marriage, particularly if it was more than 7 years old. It also shows that husbands who experienced some form of violence during their first year of marriage continued to experience the same for the rest of their lives. It is not something that just goes away. The study shows that domestic violence is a public health issue with far-reaching health consequences, such as mental illness and stress disorders, that need to be addressed. The study also shows that domestic violence is perpetrated across all socioeconomic classes (see Table 1). The study reports that a high proportion of husbands who experienced domestic violence were well educated and earning good money. Men tolerate and stay in abusive and violent relationship for many reasons. Some of the reasons ‚Äò‚Äòwhy men tolerate domestic violence and abuse‚Äô‚Äô are the belief and hope that things would get better, fear of losing social respect and position, protection, and love toward their children and family. Many abused men feel that they have to make their marriages work. They are afraid that if things fall apart, they will be blamed. Many abused men also believe that it is their fault and feel that they deserve the treatment they receive. Another reason is increasing economic and other dependency on women. The Labor and Employment Ministry data for 2001‚Äì2005 reports that the number of women getting employment is higher than for men. The report (Sarkar et al., 2007) also shows that the number of employed men dropped by 14 lakh, from 228.4 lakh in 2001 to 214.4 lakh in 2005. In cases where an abused man is mentally, emotionally, or financially dependent on the woman, the idea of leaving the relationship generates feeling of depression and anxiety.', 'Rape : Acc. to a ', ' by National Women and Children comission carried out in 2007, when 53.2% of children reported having experienced some form of sexual abuse.

325,"With single data source, India tends to underreport road crash deaths","India banks solely on police data for estimating deaths in road accidents, ignoring other critical sources, leading to a data gap that impairs its emergency response system, makes it difficult to design and implement accident prevention strategies, and

leads to an underestimation of accidental deaths, experts say.

The World Health Organization (WHO) classified India's official data on road traffic fatalities as ""unusable"" or ""unavailable"" because of ""quality issues"" in its 2019 Global Health Estimates released in December 2020. This study is still the latest available source of global data on death and disability by region, country, age, sex and cause.

In its methods and country-level data sources handbook, the WHO pointed out that it has official figures from India for only 2001-2003 and 2010-2013. For the remaining years, it has had to collate numbers from the Global Burden of Diseases(2019) study produced by its partnering institute, the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), an independent research center at the University of Washington, said a WHO statistician who did not wish to be named.



The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH)'s data on road crash deaths are not complete because the data reporting process of the police departments is flawed, there is significant underreporting especially in rural India, and not enough public trust in the police, experts told IndiaSpend.



The WHO classifies all countries into four categories on the basis of data availability on the cause of death: ""high completeness"", ""low completeness and/or issues with cause-of-death assignment"", ""low completeness with severe quality issues"" and ""data are unavailable"".



In the case of road deaths, for example, Japan is listed in the ""high completeness"" category and Thailand in ""low completeness"", while India's numbers are categorised as ""data are unavailable"". While Japan collates road deaths data from sources such as hospitals, ambulance services, forensic investigation of crash sites and insurance providers, Thailandbanks on its ministries of public health, interior and transport and so on for estimates.



However, this gap is normal because the WHO and the Indian government use different methods to collect numbers and it is difficult to prove which method is more robust, Anshuman Mohanty, economic advisor, Transport Research Wing, MoRTH, told IndiaSpend.



A comprehensive crash investigation system is required to offer every stakeholder--the public, the police and policy makers--strong evidence on the contributing factors, wrote Benedicta Isaac-Kumar, a consultant with Chennai-based Citizen consumer and civic Action Group, a non-profit, voluntary and professional citizens group.



Why police data are incomplete



In India, there are two reports on data relating to road traffic accidents--the 'Road Accidents in India' report of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and the 'Crime in India' report of the Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). As in many countries, the data are sourced entirely from the police departments of states and union territories.



Here is how the police collect crash information. Once they are informed about a by someone involved in the mishap, a witness or a police officer at the site, a First Information Report (FIR) is recorded.Its content can only be changed with the permission of the High Court or the Supreme Court of India, explains a 2020 Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT-Delhi) study. Once the investigation concludes, a case file is prepared. After this, the offending party is charged under provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Motor Vehicles Act of India 1988.



In the case of serious injuries and instantaneous death, the survivor or the victim's family may file an FIR only if they want to pursue the case in a court or claim compensation, insurance after adjudication by the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal.



The IIT study also reported that most cases are attributed to ""human error"" and this means that factors such as vehicular and infrastructural problems are not included. The cause of the crash has to be recorded as the ""fault"" of a ""road user"" as per the India Penal Code (IPC) and Motor Vehicle Act 1988, ignoring all other factors.



On the shortcomings of the data reporting mechanism in India, the MoRTH report itself pointed out that if a victim dies in a hospital after 30 days of the accident, it is not reported as a road traffic fatality.



""Collecting data from different sources to build meaningful analysis of road crashes is vital,"" said Piyush Tewari, founder of the New Delhi-based SaveLIFE Foundation (SLF), an independent non-profit organisation focussed on improving road safety and emergency medical care. ""For example, data can be collected from police officials, ambulance service providers, information from bystanders etc.""



""We don't have any trauma registry database where hospitals need to report deaths or injuries, like now all hospitals need to report Covid-19 cases on a central portal,"" M.C. Misra, the former director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), told IndiaSpend.



Underreporting of deaths



Due to the inadequate police presence in India's rural areas, it is possible that about 50% of road crash deaths there go unreported, said the IIT study. For urban pockets, this figure is lower but still significant, 10-20%. In urban areas, most of the road accident deaths and injuries get reported which occur in a hospital. Due to the sparse density of hospitals in rural areas, the chances of missing accidents, deaths and injuries are higher.



Data on non-fatal crash injuries in India may also be unreliable because survivors may choose not to report them to the police or hospitals, the IIT Delhi study noted.



Lack of trust, bias



Road traffic accidents and injuries go unreported because of entrenched biases among both the police and civilians. Accident survivors in India are reluctant to report cases because they believe the police to be apathetic and also because they do not want to be caught up in lengthy police procedures, especially in rural areas, said G. Gururaj, former director of the Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS). He pointed to the fact that in rural areas, an accident victim is first cremated and then the case reported to the police.



When accidents occur, police officials tend to assume that drivers of large vehicles such as truck drivers are at fault, ignoring the conditions of the vehicle, fatigue among drivers, road conditions, and so on, said Tewari of SLF, adding that this is why truck drivers tend not to report accidents. About 40% of respondents in the 2020 SLF survey on truck drivers said they were dissatisfied with their jobs because of harassment from the police, the transport authorities and local residents.

Skewed distribution of traffic resources



Police departments are also stretched for human and other resources. About 27% of the vacancies in traffic police departments across India have yet to be filled, according to the 2020 Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) report on 'Data on Police Organizations'. Eight states--Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat, Telangana, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar--have more than 40% of posts waiting to be filled in their traffic police forces. Among them, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Gujarat appear in the top 10 list of most number of road accidents in India in 2019, per MoRTH report.



The deployment of traffic constables and head constables in states does not align with the vehicular density of states. An average 26% of posts lie unfilled in the traffic police departments of 10 states with the most vehicular density, shows a combined analysis of the MoRTH's 2017-18 and 2018-19 Road Transport Year Book report and the BPR&D report.

Finding solutions



To allow the data on road accidents to be more robust, the government introduced the 2019 Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act (MVAA). It aimed to enable officials to investigate road crashes for better and more comprehensive data.



The government also launched the Integrated Road Accident Database (iRAD) project. The iRAD is a central accident database management system launched in January 2020 that connects information from multiple sources--hospitals, ambulance services, blood banks, insurance companies, and so on. It was deployed for ""live accident data entry"" in six states--Maharashtra,



Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu--in February 2021. Its data processing mechanism was still in progress as of March 18, 2021, Gadkari said responding to a question during the March 2021 parliament session.

The SLF has started training traffic police in India's 15 most accident-prone states, including Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Delhi, Telangana, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Chattisgarh. The Uttar Pradesh police have started conducting forensic investigations for road crashes on the Yamuna Expressway in collaboration with the SaveLIFE Foundation.



However, data integration is challenging in India because it is ""a poor country"" with ""a lot of diversity"", Mohanty, economic advisor, Transport Research Wing, MoRTH, told IndiaSpend. ""I don't have any update on the implementation of iRAD in India. I have to check,"" he added.



Case study: Why data is critical



In 2016, the SLF collaborated with the Maharashtra government on a Zero Fatality Corridor (ZFC) project on the 95.4-km Mumbai-Pune Expressway (MPEW), aiming to create a safety model that could be replicated across roads in India. They looked for solutions in four areas commonly stated as ""4 E's of Road Safety"": engineering, emergency care, enforcement and engagement.



The project undertook various initiatives--issued 46,563 challans using speed-traps, installed Vehicle Activated Speed Sign (VASS) to alert motorists about speeding and barricaded 10,300 parked or stalled vehicles to prevent rear-end collisions.



As a part of the initiative, around 150 km of Tactile Edge Lines--yellow road tiles to indicate hazards and the direction of travel--were installed on the highway to address fatigue-related crashes. The project also pinpointed 15 types of road engineering errors--poorly designed slopes and lack of siding space for trucks on uphill tracts--which had been repeated 2,145 times across the two corridors of the highway. Later, these engineering errors were rectified by the SLF in collaboration with the state government.



The SLF also developed a 'Chain of Survival' initiative consisting of on-ground, ambulance and in-hospital care services for road accident victims.



This model helped slash the number of road crash fatalities on the MPEW by 43% between 2016 and 2021--the numbers fell from 151 to 86. Replication of this model, the use of data science and forensic investigation--all these can make Indian roads safer, said Tewari of SLF.","Why police data are incompleteIn India, there are two reports on data relating to road traffic accidents--the 'Road Accidents in India' report of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and the 'Crime in India' report of the Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).

326,Road accidents can be reduced,"Public discourse, improving infrastructure can help

Fifty-one passengers of an overcrowded bus died in an accident on the morning of February 16 when it fell into a canal near Sarda Patan village in Sidhi district, Madhya Pradesh. A griha pravesh (house-warming) ceremony for the beneficiaries of one lakh houses constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana in Bhopal, which was to be attended virtually by Union Home Minister Amit Shah, was cancelled due to the incident. Two days earlier, fourteen persons were killed when a minivan they were travelling in hit a divider on a National Highway (NH) near Madarpur village in Kurnool district, Andhra Pradesh. The van carrying 18 passengers was on its way to Ajmer in Rajasthan from Chittoor, when the driver lost control and hit the divider, tumbling on the other side of the road where a speeding truck crashed into it.

According to a study conducted by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, 1,51,113 persons were killed and 4,51,361 injured in road accidents across the country in 2019. NHs and State Highways, which account for about 5% of the total road length, claimed 61% of the deaths related to accidents. Around 35,606 deaths were reported on the NHs, which come under the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).

Speaking at a webinar organised by the International Road Federation on February 9, Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said India topped the fatality figures in road accidents in the world, with 415 deaths each day. While commending Tamil Nadu for taking effective road safety measures that had resulted in the reduction of road accidents by 38% and deaths by 54%, he asked other States to emulate Tamil Nadu.

It is small wonder that he actively pursued the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, with the well-intentioned motive of bringing down the death rate due to road accidents by 50% by 2020. This was agreed to by all participating nations in the United Nations Brasilia Declaration, of which India was a signatory. Though the number of deaths due to accidents declined to 1.20 lakh in 2020 due to COVID-19, Mr. Gadkari shifted the deadline to 2025.

But the steep hike in the fines imposed for traffic violations in the Act was met with stiff opposition, with some States dismissing it as too harsh and, hence, not willing to implement it. What seems to have been ignored while drafting the law was the fact that a good number of those driving vehicles to earn their livelihood were from economically poor backgrounds. West Bengal decided not to implement the new law and continued with the West Bengal Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989.

The Madras High Court recently struck down the April 6, 2018 notification of the Union Government wherein the speed limit was hiked to 120 and 100 km/hour on expressways and highways, respectively. This was done as 66.7% of accidents was attributed to overspeeding in 2017, 55.73% in 2018 and 64.4% in 2019.

Studies carried out by various organisations have also come out with the causes for accidents and ways to curb them. The Accident Research Cell of the Delhi Traffic Police carried out an analysis of accidents and created a database that facilitates the formulation of policies to prevent accidents. While probing an accident that led to the death of former Union Rural Development Minister Gopinath Munde in New Delhi, the cell concluded that hedges along a road obstructed the visibility of drivers coming from the other direction. After the hedges were pruned, the stretch became free from accidents.

While the strict enforcement of traffic safety laws would go a long way, educating citizens about the impact of accidents on the kin of the victims through public discourse could help in reducing accidents. Improving road infrastructure with coordinated efforts by the police and civic authorities, identification of black spots that are prone to accidents and deploying an adequate number of police personnel, particularly during peak hours, could bring down accident rates. Highway patrols with police personnel trained in first aid and ambulances every 10 km could also help save precious lives.

327,India loses 1.5 lakh lives due to road accidents every year; here is how most of them can be saved,"While India accounts for about 1% of motor vehicles globally, it records more than 11% of road traffic deaths

Every year, the lives of 1.3 million people are cut short due to road accidents. In India itself, around 150,000 people lose their lives on roads every year. While India accounts for about 1 percent of motor vehicles globally, it records more than 11 percent of road traffic deaths.

In the past few years, countries like Sweden, Australia and the United Kingdom have improved their road safety outcomes through effective central legislation. India too enacted the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act, 2019. It was the result of a five-year effort to improve national legislation on road safety. The enactment of the new legislation is a positive step; however, even after two years, the situation on the ground has not improved much.

While implementation of the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act 2019 needs to be done on a priority basis, this article highlights three additional steps to be undertaken to improve road safety in our country.

Adopting the safe system approach

Traditionally, road safety interventions have revolved around modifying human behaviour to prevent road crashes. However, the safe system approach hinges on the principle that human beings will make mistakes, and the risk of these mistakes should not result in a fatality or a serious injury.

Today, city agencies are more concerned with moving motor vehicles as quickly as possible, even at the cost of risking the lives of pedestrians and cyclists. About 90 percentof the pedestrian deaths recorded in Gurugram in 2020 occurred on national highways, state highways or expressways, all high-speed corridors.

It is essential that speed along these corridors, especially at the intersection, needs to be brought down to a safe limit, which can be accomplished with a good design. However, any efforts to increase speed will only lead to an increase in traffic crashes, especially those involving vulnerable road users.

Importance of ‚Äòsafer‚Äô infrastructure

Traditionally, the 5Es of road safety involves ‚Äî Education, Encouragement, Enforcement, Evaluation, and Engineering. Most often, education is the first E, and the last E is engineering.

Yes, road safety education is essential, but empirical studies from around the world have shown that ‚Äòeducation‚Äô alone does not improve road safety. What is needed is safe infrastructure and safe vehicles, in addition to road users, who follow safety rules.

However, ‚Äòroad safety‚Äô dialogues in India still do not highlight the importance of safer roads.

The starting point of creating safer roads is by collecting data on road traffic crashes and geocoding the location of these crashes. The analysis of this data will help identify high-risk roads and sites, also called ‚Äúblackspots‚Äù and improving the infrastructure of these locations will improve overall safety. Also, road safety audits and inspection of existing and new roads will ensure a gradual decrease in ‚Äúblackspots‚Äù.

Managing speeds

Managing speed to improve safety does not come naturally to us. That is because we have still not understood the impact of speed, especially in areas where highways and other high-speed corridors interact with pedestrians and slow-moving traffic.

For example, if a pedestrian is hit by a car at 30 kmph, their chance of survival is 90 percent. However, if the same collision occurs at 50 kmph, which is the legal speed limit, the likelihood is only 15 percent.

India is a signatory to the Stockholm Declaration of 2020. The biggest and the boldest recommendation from the Stockholm Declaration is on speed. The declaration asks members to mandate a maximum travel speed of 30 km/h in areas where non-motorised road users and motor vehicles mix frequently. It means that the streets inside the city need to be designed and enforced for a maximum speed of 30 km/h or less. Reducing speed, in general, also has a positive impact on air quality and climate change and reduces road traffic deaths and injuries.

Road traffic crashes are an epidemic in India. It is not only a public health issue but an economic one. The country loses $58 billion, or 3 percent of its GDP, every year due to road traffic crashes. The COVID-19 crisis did halt the mobility, but things are improving, and the country is moving towards a post-Covid scenario.

Therefore, it needs to build back better, which would be impossible without addressing the critical issue of road safety. After all, the benefits of improving road safety go far beyond increasing the overall quality of life for India‚Äôs citizens and will undoubtedly save many lives.

328,1.2 lakh people died in road accidents in 2020: NCRB,"India saw 1.35 lakh cases of hit-and-run since 2018, the data show.

India recorded 1.2 lakh cases of ‚Äúdeaths due to negligence relating to road accidents‚Äù in 2020, with 328 persons losing their lives every day on an average, despite the COVID-19 lockdown, according to government data.

As many as 3.92 lakh lives have been lost in three years in deaths due to negligence related to road accidents, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) revealed in its annual ‚ÄòCrime India‚Äô report for 2020. While 1.2 lakh deaths were recorded in 2020, the figures stood at 1.36 lakh in 2019 and 1.35 lakh in 2018, the data show.

329,"Centres newest way to address road fatalities, cash rewards for Good Samaritans","From signing the Brasilia Declaration to the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act, 2019, the government has taken up several measures to reduce road mishaps

Being a Good Samaritan pays! At least, it will now.

As per a recent notification by the road ministry, anyone who saves the life of a road accident victim by rushing them to a hospital within the ‚Äògolden hour‚Äô will be rewarded Rs 5,000 for their effort.

The Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has issued guidelines for the scheme, which will be in place from 15 October 2021 till 31 March, 2026.

MoRTH has announced award scheme of Rs. 5,000 to Good Samaritan, w.e.f. 15 October. https://t.co/FQxpKndOwS pic.twitter.com/YfNQCHTOyI ‚Äî MORTHINDIA (@MORTHIndia) October 6, 2021

The government has been implementing several plans to make the country‚Äôs roads safe for travelling.

Road accidents in India

A report, titled Guide for Road Safety Opportunities and Challenges: Low- and Middle-Income Countries Country Profiles, by the World Bank revealed that with only one percent of the world's vehicles, India accounted for 11 percent of the global death in road accidents, the highest in the world in 2019.

Data showed that the country accounts for about 4.5 lakh road crashes per annum, in which 1.5 lakh people die. The report further stated that India witnessed 53 road crashes every hour; killing one person every four minutes.

The road ministry also stated that 76.2 percent of people who died in road crashes are in the age group of 18-45 years.

The situation is so dire in the nation that Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Nitin Gakdari had been quoted as saying that the road accident scenario in India was more ""dangerous than the COVID-19 pandemic"".

A recent study commissioned by MoRTH estimated the socio-economic costs of road crashes at Rs 1,47,114 crore in India, which is equivalent to 0.77 percent of the country's GDP.

Brasilia Declaration on Road Safety

Taking into consideration the high number of deaths on roads across the globe, in 2015, the World Health Organisation came up with the Brasilia Declaration, which called out for stringent traffic laws to prevent accidents.

In the declaration, participating countries asserted their commitment to reducing the deaths caused due to traffic accidents to half by the year 2020. This target was set under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. India adopted the same in 2015, with Nitin Gadkari signing it on behalf of India at the 2nd High Level Global Conference.

However, India hasn't been able to achieve the goal of cutting road death rates by 50 percent. Gadkari said that a total of 366,138 road accidents occurred in India during the calendar year 2020, a drop from the 4,37,396 road accident cases in 2019.

Similarly deaths have also reduced with India reporting 1,31,714 deaths in 2020 compared to 1,54,732 in 2019.

Motor Vehicles Amendment Act, 2019

Another way the government has tried to reduce road deaths is by implementing the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act, 2019.

The legislation increased the penalties for traffic violations, defective vehicles and juvenile driving.

It also provides for a Motor Vehicle Accident Fund, which would provide compulsory insurance cover to all road users in India for certain types of accidents.

When introduced in September 2019, many had criticised it saying that the amendment to the law was solely done to earn money from traffic violations. However, defending the move, Nitin Gadkari had reiterated that the idea of increasing the penalty against the violators was not to earn money but to save the life of many stakeholders who could be involved in road traffic accidents.

In fact, Nitin Gadkari told the Lok Sabha in November 2019 that road accidents and fatalities reduced nine percent in at least nine states after the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 came into effect from 1 September 2019.

During September-October 2019, 3,375 people died in road accidents in comparison to 3,729 deaths during the same period in 2018.

Moreover, the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 had also inserted a new section 134A for the protection of good Samaritans who come to the aid of road accident victims.

The rules provided for the Rights of Good Samaritan, which include that the person shall be treated respectfully without any discrimination on the grounds of religion, nationality, caste or sex.

The rule also stated that every public and private hospital shall publish a charter in Hindi, English and vernacular language, at the entrance or other conspicuous location and on their website, stating the rights of good Samaritans under the Act and the rules made thereunder.

And on 5 October, the government said that a good Samaritan would be given a cash award of Rs 5,000 if he rushed a road accident victim to the hospital within the 'golden hour' of the mishap.

For those who don't know, the 'Golden hour' refers to the one-hour time period following a traumatic injury during which there is the highest likelihood of preventing death by providing prompt medical care.

Better roads

Other than the new legislation, the government has also acknowledged the role that the quality of roads play in accidents.

As one can imagine, faulty roads are accident-prone and curves on roads and potholes are contributing factors to road accidents.

The Road Accidents in India 2018 report by MoRTH showed that roads with sharp curves, potholes and steep gradients tend to be more accident-prone because successfully negotiating them requires skill, extra care and alertness.

Additionally, speeding on highways is another reason for accidents.

KK Kapila, President Emeritus of International Road Federation was quoted as telling Deccan Herald, ""Accidents are caused due to the tendency to over-speed on the good quality of Expressways and Highways wherein the safety parameters are often compromised to reduce costs.""

Road discipline

Road discipline is one thing that is lacking among drivers, which leads to accidents and fatalities.

Drivers and two-wheeler users often are found not wearing seatbelts and helmets respectively.

For this, the government has carried out several public service announcements, emphasising the importance of both and also imposed heavy fines for those who don't comply.

Nitin Gadkari hopes that reduction deaths in road accidents to go down by 50 percent before 2025. He had also said that if ""we keep waiting till 2030, then at least six-seven lakh people will die more due to road accidents"".

Will we be able to achieve this goal? Let's hope so!

‚ÄúThe amount of award for each Good Samaritan would be Rs. 5,000 per incident. Every cash award would be accompanied with a certification of appreciation,"" it said. Golden hour is the one hour period after a traumatic injury and there is the highest likelihood of preventing death by providing prompt medical care to the victim.

Rules for Good Samaritans was notified by the ministry on September 29, 2020, as per the provisions under Section 134A of the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act, 2019.

According to the ministry‚Äôs guidelines, an individual Good Samaritan can be awarded a maximum of five times a year. The ministry also said there will be 10 national-level awards for the most worthy Good Samaritans, who will be selected from all those who have been awarded during an entire year, and they would be given an award of ‚Çπ100,000 each. Under the guidelines, if more than one Good Samaritan saves the life of more than one victim, the amount of award will be ‚Çπ5,000 for every person saved, subject to a maximum of ‚Çπ5,000 per Good Samaritan. The ministry said it will provide ‚Çπ5 lakh as an initial grant to the transport department of states and Union territories for rewarding the Good Samaritans.

The guidelines say that in case the Good Samaritan informs the police about the accident, the police will provide an acknowledgement to the person after verifying details from a doctor on an official letter pad. The copy of the acknowledgement would then be sent to the appraisal committee formed at the district level under the chairmanship of the district magistrate by the concerned police station. And, a copy will be marked to the Good Samaritan. If the Good Samaritan takes the road accident victim to the hospital directly, the hospital will provide all the details to the concerned police station. The police shall provide an acknowledgement to such Good Samaritan, it added.

Last month, the Rajasthan government announced a similar reward for Good Samaritans who save lives by taking road accident victims to hospitals. It said that the ‚Çπ5,000 cash reward will be given under the Mukhyamantri Chiranjeevi Jeevan Rakshak Yojna. The person will also be given a certificate, it added.

335,"Jagran Explainer | Fixed driving hours, sleep detection sensor: Nitin Gadkari's proposed plan aims to reduce road accidents in India","New Delhi | Jagran News Desk: Road accidents are one of the common problems in India. With only 1 per cent of the world's vehicles, India accounts for 11 per cent of the global death in road accidents, the highest in the world, according to a report by the World Bank. Accidents by truck drivers constitute a large part of this logistics. Over-speeding, fatigue, and sleepiness are the major causes of road crashes by truck drivers in India.

In a bid to reduce road accidents and give relief to truck drivers, Union Minister for Road Transport Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday called for fixed driving hours for truck drivers. He also directed that trucks should be fixed with onboard sleep detection sensors at par with European standards to achieve this purpose.

Measures suggested by Gadkari to reduce road accidents:

Presiding over a meeting of the National Road Safety Council (NRSC), Gadkari said that just like pilots have fixed flying hours, drivers of commercial trucks - a segment of vehicles that forms a major part of highway traffic ‚Äì should have fixed driving hours, to reduce driving fatigue.

He also directed NRSC authorities that commercial vehicles should have onboard sleep detection sensors and sought timely updates on the matter after every two months.

""Have directed officers to work on a policy to include On-Board Sleep Detection Sensors in Commercial Vehicles, at par with European standards,"" Gadkari said in a tweet.

What is sleep detection sensor?

A sleep detection sensor is a car safety technology that helps to prevent accidents when the driver gets drowsy. It sets a sleep alarm in the vehicle for detecting the condition indicative of the onset of sleepiness. For example, an eye blink sensor is used to keep track of the driver‚Äôs eyelid motion. Similarly, a vibrating device is incorporated within the driver‚Äôs seat which gets activated when the conditions are not satisfied. Sleep detection sensors are widely used in European countries in vehicles, particularly commercial vehicles, to avoid road accidents. In India, the system is still not very popular.

Road accidents in India:

According to the World Bank report, India accounts for about 4.5 lakh road crashes per annum, of which 1.5 lakh people die. Every hour 53 road crashes occur; killing 1 person every 4 minutes. In the last decade, 13 lakh people died and another 50 lakh got injured on Indian roads.

A recent study commissioned by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) estimates the socio-economic costs of road crashes at Rs 1,47,114 crore in India, which is equivalent to 0.77 per cent of the country's GDP.

At the individual level, road crash injuries and deaths impose a severe financial burden and push entire (non-poor) households into poverty and the already poor into debt.

336,Five killed in accidents during Puja days in Tripura,"Five people were killed and 13 sustained injuries in separate accidents amid Puja festivities in Tripura, including one person who got crushed beneath a Durga idol during immersion at Lefunga in West Tripura, the police said. Besides, a case of gang rape was registered in Dhalai district‚Äôs Salema.

Speaking to indianexpress.com, Inspector General (law and order) Arindam Nath said a road accident left two dead in 43 Mile area of Mungiyakami in Khowai district, 40 km from Agartala, on Tuesday when a car travelling from Ambassa in Dhalai district towards Teliamura in Khowai allegedly lost control near a curve and fell into a deep gorge.

‚ÄúFive persons were reported to have died in four accidents. Among these, one person fell beneath a Durga Puja idol at Lefunga. Two others died when a vehicle rolled down a gorge. Two others were killed in road accidents,‚Äù the official said.

According to officials at the police headquarters, 13 persons sustained injuries in road accidents at Champahower in Khowai district. This includes two traffic police personnel, one of whom was hit by a speeding vehicle which tried to flee after violating traffic rules at Teliamura. Three others were injured after a brick-laden truck fell into a ditch at Jogirampara area of Madhupur in West Tripura.

Meanwhile, three persons were arrested in the wake of the gang-rape case registered on Thursday at Salema police station, the IG informed. Further investigation in the case is underway, he said.

The official added that as many as 7,660 police personnel were deployed across the state to maintain law and order and oversee traffic movement during Durga Puja days this year. Besides, eight platoons of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were deployed in areas under eight major police stations to strengthen security measures and ensure that the festive season was peaceful.

As per reports, Durga Puja was celebrated in 2,176 pandals and other locations across Tripura, including 865 pujas organised in urban areas and 1,311 in rural areas. Sensitive places were kept under CCTV surveillance.

Power cuts were reported in different parts of the state ‚Äì especially at Udaipur in Gomati district ‚Äì leaving residents in discomfort. Sources in the Met Department attributed the increased sensation of heat to high levels of humidity. Meanwhile, there were also reports of disruption in drinking water supply.

Appealing for religious cooperation and brotherhood, Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb met leaders of all religious communities on Bijoya Dashami and exchanged pleasantries.","Five people were killed and 13 sustained injuries in separate accidents amid Puja festivities in Tripura, including one person who got crushed beneath a Durga idol during immersion at Lefunga in West Tripura, the police said.

337,"New ‚Çπ 7,270 crore scheme for road safety in 14 States","The scheme will incentivise State governments to drive road safety interventions at the grassroots level.

The Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) is all set to roll out a new ‚Çπ7,270 crore State Support Programme for Strengthening Road Safety to help realise the vision of 'Zero road fatalities on Indian roads.' The centrally-sponsored six-year programme will be implemented in 14 States that are now contributing to 85% of the total road fatalities in the country.

While MoRTH will lend a budgetary support of ‚Çπ3,635 crore, an amount of ‚Çπ1,818 crore will be secured as loan each from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

Of the total cost, ‚Çπ6,725 crore will be disbursed to the 14 States based on their performance while MoRTH will use ‚Çπ545 crore for capacity building activities.

The scheme will incentivise State governments to drive road safety interventions at the grassroots level with the main objective of curbing road accidents and achieving a reduction in fatalities, the MoRTH said in a concept note circulated to the target States.

The target States under the scheme are Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Bihar, Telangana, West Bengal, Odisha, Haryana and Assam.

""This is an output and outcome-driven scheme wherein the performance of the States will be assessed on 11 mandatory and three elective indicators (road safety interventions). The grants will be distributed to the States based on the Key Performance Indicators,"" top official sources told PTI.

The preliminary project report prepared by MoRTH says the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act (2019) was brought in as an important intervention to achieve the fatality reduction target.

""To leverage the strengthened law, it is necessary to have focused interventions in the related areas of road safety like road engineering, enforcement, road safety advocacy and media campaigns and efficient emergency response systems. The States need to be supported to act on result-oriented strategies. Hence the new scheme,"" the sources said.

India reported about 1.51 lakh road deaths in 4.49 lakh accidents in the year 2019. Of the total deaths, the 14 identified States accounted for 1,27,379.

The number of fatalities remained consistent over the last five years.

In 2020, 1.32 lakh road deaths were recorded across the country, with the COVID-19-induced lockdown resulting in the reduction in number.

The new scheme targets to reduce the fatality rate by 30% by March 2027.

Cyclists, two and three-wheeler riders and pedestrians have been identified as 'vulnerable road users' who comprised about 54% of road traffic deaths in India.

Under the new scheme, performance-based indicators have been proposed with the aim of reducing the impact of road accidents on these vulnerable users.

An Integrated Road Accident Database (IRAD) will be rolled out in all States by 2022-23 and applied for identifying and rectifying all black spots on State highways and major district roads.

Road safety audit will be made mandatory on State highways and urban roads by the end of the scheme period.

From 2022-23, MoRTH will launch a 'Challenge Round' every year to provide incentives to States on additional road safety interventions and also to promote competition among States.

""The grant of Rs 7,270 crore will only meet partial fund requirement for the scheme. States are expected to make their own budgetary allocations and also implement projects in Public-Private Partnership mode,"" MoRTH told the States.

Independent Verification Agencies will scrutinise the States' achievements, based on which the Central grant will be released.

Some of the other major interventions mooted under the scheme are: Installation of speed management devices on urban roads in cities with a population of over four lakh, State highways and national highways for increased enforcement, a unique number for reporting accidents, development of dedicated lanes for two-wheelers on State highways and urban roads and identification of priority corridors.

State Education Boards will be required to introduce a chapter on road safety for classes 6-9 in 2022-23 and up to class-12 the next year on.

Deployment of Advance Traffic Management System, campaigns on vehicle safety and driver training, establishment of a Command and Control (Data) Centre for ambulances, establishment of automated vehicle fitness centres are some of the other initiatives planned under the scheme.","The scheme will incentivise State governments to drive road safety interventions at the grassroots level.

338,Good Samaritans to be paid ‚Çπ5k for rushing road accident victims to hospital,"The road ministry on Monday said it has launched a scheme for 'Good Samaritans' under which a cash award of ‚Çπ5,000 will be given to those who save the life of a road accident victim by rushing him/her to hospital within the 'golden hour' of the mishap.

In a letter to principal and transport secretaries of all states and union territories, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) said the scheme would be effective from October 15, 2021 till March 31, 2026.

The ministry on Monday issued guidelines for the ""scheme for grant of award to the Good Samaritan who has saved life of a victim of a fatal accident involving a motor vehicle by administering immediate assistance and rushing to hospital/trauma Care Centre within the Golden Hour of the accident to provide medical treatment.""

To motivate the general public to help the road accident victims in an emergency situation, MoRTH said "" the amount of award for each Good Samaritan would be Rs. 5,000 per incident.""

""Every cash award would be accompanied with a certification of appreciation,"" it added.

Besides award in each case, the ministry said there will be 10 national level awards for the most worthy Good Samaritans (to be selected from all those who have been awarded during the whole year) and they would be given an award of ‚Çπ1,00,000 each.

According to the guidelines, if more than one Good Samaritan saves the life of more than one victim, the amount of award will be ‚Çπ5,000 per victim saved, subject to maximum ‚Çπ5,000 per Good Samaritan.

'Golden hour' refers to the 1-hour time period following a traumatic injury during which there is the highest likelihood of preventing death by providing prompt medical care.

MoRTH said it will provide ‚Çπ5 lakh as initial grant to the transport department of states and UTs for making payment to the Good Samaritan.

As per provisions under Section 134A of the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act 2019, rules for Good Samaritans had been notified by the ministry on September 29, 2020.

""Now, it has been felt that there is a need to motivate the general public through cash awards and certificates to help the road accident victims in emergency situation and to boost their moral, and also to inspire and motivate others to save lives of the road accident victims,"" the ministry said.

According to the guidelines, in case the incident is informed to the police at the first hand by the Good Samaritan, after verifying details from doctor, the police shall provide an acknowledgment to such Good Samaritan on an official letter pad.

The copy of the acknowledgement would be sent to the appraisal committee formed at district level under the chairmanship of district magistrate by the concerned police station, with a copy marked to the Good Samaritan.

In case the Good Samaritan takes the victim to the hospital directly, the hospital shall provide all the details to the concerned police station.

The police shall provide an acknowledgment to such Good Samaritan, it added.

As per the guidelines, an individual Good Samaritan can be awarded a maximum five times in a year.

Replying to a question in the Lok Sabha recently, Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari had said a total of 3,66,138 road accidents occurred in India during the calendar year 2020, causing 1,31,714 deaths.

340,DRDO Awards Student Rs 3 Lakh For Innovation That Reduces Casualties in Accidents,"From deadly crashes to runway mishaps, aircraft accidents are inevitable. In 2019, India saw over 280 deaths caused by aircraft accidents.

To minimise this damage, aircraft and other vehicles are built using a composite material like glass fibre to add tensile strength. However, these materials are flammable.

To reduce the chances of the vehicle catching fire owing to the material, Pravin Nagendran (21), a third-year Biotechnology student of Bannari Amman Engineering College, Erode began working on a plant-based alternative.

‚ÄúMaterials like glass fibre are made from epoxy resin which contains petroleum. This makes it highly flammable. But a plant-based epoxy resin would not only be cost-effective but also safer. Besides being used as a material for building aircrafts, it can also be used in other vehicles to prevent the risk of fire,‚Äù says Pravin, in an interview with The Better India.

A flame-resistant material

In 2019, Pravin started working on the project and began thinking of alternative elements to make composite materials. With help from his faculty members Kirupa Sankar, A Vimmalarasan, and Ravi Kumar, he spent one year identifying various biomaterials.

‚ÄúAfter one year of research, we finalised a specific plant whose name we cannot mention,‚Äù says Pravin, adding that he had to put his project on hold for a few months owing to the COVID-19 lockdowns.

However, once he had access to his college‚Äôs laboratory, he began working on a prototype. He finalised the material within three months with help from four of his friends.

‚ÄúIt was made by extracting nanoparticles from the ash of the plant. This was incorporated with natural fibre composite to make a flame-resistant material. A plant-based extract was used even for binding,‚Äù says Pravin.

To test its resistance to fire, the material was heated at high temperatures. Pravin says the results showed that it was 100% resistant to fire and stayed intact. Since the material is extracted from a plant, Pravin says it is biodegradable and environment-friendly as well.

He submitted his project to the Defense Research and Development Organisation‚Äôs contest, Dare to Dream 2.0. After passing three rounds, Pravin‚Äôs project won third place among 65,000 participants and he received prize money of Rs 3 lakh.

‚ÄúNow, I am working on developing the material further to improve its tensile strength. I hope to commercialise it after I am done with college and launch a startup,‚Äù says Pravin.

341,India's journey from recognizing the 'Good Samaritan' to extending rights and now a cash award,"The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) recently issued guidelines for a new scheme to extend cash award of Rs. 5,000 to the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô who provides emergency assistance to victims of fatal accidents. Here is a review of India‚Äôs journey from recognizing the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô to extending them rights and now a cash award.

Injuries in road accidents are among the top 10 causes of deaths globally. In 2019, over 4.49 lakh road accidents were reported in India and over 1.51 lakh persons lost their lives in these accidents. Between 2010 and 2019, a total of 14.4 lakh deaths have been reported due to road accidents in the country.

India ranks first in terms of the absolute number of deaths in road accidents among 199 countries, and deaths due to road accidents in India alone account for 11% of the accident-related deaths in the world. In India, road injuries are the leading cause of death among young adult males. With increasing vehicle population and vehicle density on roads, the probability of accidents & deaths due to them is more than before.

50% of the fatalities in road accidents could have been averted if prompt medical service was given

One major reason for the high fatalities in road accidents is the lack of timely medical treatment for victims. According to a 2006 report of the Law Commission of India, 50% of the fatalities could have been averted if victims were admitted to a hospital within the first one hour, which is called the golden hour. Lives could be saved if emergency medical treatment is provided immediately. Unfortunately, many bystanders and passers-by are hesitant to help the injured accident victims because of the fear of police harassment, detention at hospitals, and prolonged legal formalities. To encourage people to come forward and render help to the accident victims, legal protection, and perks for ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô are necessary.

A ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô is a person who, in good faith, without expectation of payment or reward and without any duty of care or special relationship, voluntarily comes forward to administer immediate assistance or emergency care to a person injured in an accident, or crash, or emergency medical condition, or emergency situation. A ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô law is supposed to safeguard such individuals from harassment & legal hassles they may have to undergo for saving the lives of victims.

PIL in 2012 brought attention to the issue of protecting ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô

A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed in the Supreme Court in 2012 requesting the Court to safeguard ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô who come forward to help the injured, paved the way for legal protection and encouragement of ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô. Following the apex court‚Äôs orders, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), in 2015, notified guidelines about the protection of ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô as an interim measure until appropriate legislation is made by the Union government. Later in 2016, MoRTH issued a Standard Operating Procedure for the examination of ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô during the trial.

Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 included provisions for ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô in legislation

A new section 134A titled ‚ÄòProtection of Good Samaritans‚Äô was inserted through the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, which provides that ‚Äòa Good Samaritan shall not be liable for any civil or criminal action for any injury to or death of the victim of an accident involving a motor vehicle, where such injury or death resulted from the Good Samaritan‚Äôs negligence in acting or failing to act while rendering emergency medical or non-medical care or assistance and that the Central Government may by rules provide for the procedure for questioning or examination of the Good Samaritan, disclosure of personal information of the Good Samaritan and such other related matters.‚Äô

In 2020, MoRTH published relevant rules laying down the ‚ÄòRights of Good Samaritan‚Äô. The rules make it clear that it is the voluntary choice of the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô to disclose his/her name, identity, address or any such other personal details and no police officer or any other person shall compel a ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô to do so.

The scheme for awarding ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô was recently announced by MoRTH

On 05 October 2021, MoRTH issued guidelines for the ‚ÄòScheme for grand of award to the Good Samaritan‚Äô, to motivate the general public to help the road accident victims in emergency situations. The scheme will be effective from 15 October 2021 and operational until 31 March 2026.

Under the scheme, any individual who has saved the life of a victim of a fatal accident involving a motor vehicle by administering immediate assistance and rushing to a hospital within the ‚ÄòGolden Hour‚Äô of the accident to provide medical treatment would be eligible for a cash award and certificate of appreciation for their good deed. Golden hour is defined as the period of an hour post a traumatic injury during which the likelihood of preventing death by giving immediate medical care is the highest. A fatal accident is one which leads to a major surgery, brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, or at least 3 days of hospitalization.

Each ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô will be given a cash award and certificate

As per the guidelines, each ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô, subject to the eligibility criteria, will be given a cash award of Rs. 5,000 per incident. That is, even if they save the lives of more than one person in a single incident, they will be eligible for a cash award of Rs. 5,000 only. If more than one ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô saves the life of a victim, then the Rs. 5,000 cash awards will be split equally among them. If more than one ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô saves the life of more than one victim of an accident, then they will be given a cash award of Rs. 5,000 per victim saved subject to a maximum award of Rs. 5,000 per ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô. Further, an individual ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô can be awarded a maximum of five times in a year.

Ten worthiest ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô in the country will be awarded Rs. 1 lakh, certificate, and trophy

Apart from the cash award, a ‚ÄòCertification of Appreciation‚Äô will also be provided to the ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô. Additionally, the scheme has also announced the presentation of 10 national-level awards to be handed out annually for the worthiest ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô among those who have been awarded the whole year. The national-level award winners will get a cash award of Rs. 1 lakh each along with a Certificate and trophy during National Road Safety Month (NRSM) in Delhi.

What is the procedure to identify & award the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô?

When the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô informs the police first about the accident, the police upon receiving the required details from the Doctor will provide an acknowledgement to the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô on the official letter pad. The acknowledgement would contain details such as name, phone number, and address of the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô, details of the accident such as time, place, and date, and how the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô helped in saving the life of a victim. If the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô takes the victim to the hospital first, then the hospital must provide all the details to the concerned police station, and the police must provide an acknowledgement to the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô. The standard format for acknowledgement is provided in the guidelines.

Committees at the District, State, and National level will be set up for award purpose

A copy of the acknowledgement provided by the police is sent to the District Level Appraisal Committee comprising of District Magistrate, Chief Medical and Health Officer, RTO, and SSP. The committee will review and approve the proposals on a monthly basis. The cases are then sent to the concerned State/UT Transport Department for making the payment to the Good Samaritans. For the national-level awards, the State level committee of each State/UT must nominate the three most worthy proposals on a yearly basis. An Appraisal Committee of the MoRTH would review the proposals received from the States/UTs and select the best ten ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô of the year.

An initial grant of Rs. 5 Lakhs will be provided by MoRTH to the Transport Department of the State/UT for making payment to the ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô which would be reimbursed by the Ministry on monthly basis. A separate account is to be created for this purpose.

Different types of ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô laws exist across the World

In countries like the United States of America (USA), differing laws exist across each of the 50 states regarding the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô. For instance, the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô law in Minnesota makes it a legal obligation for the passers-by to help a person in an emergency, failure of which would fetch a penalty. Meanwhile, the law in Delaware safeguards the ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô. Furthermore, unlike in India where the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô policy is restricted to saving persons in road accidents, the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô laws in certain states of the USA are applicable to all emergency situations. In fact, there are ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô laws exclusively for helping persons with Drug Overdose and even Environmental Good Samaritans laws. In many western countries, the moral duty to stop and render treatment to an injured or ill person has been recognized instead of making it a legal requirement.

Awareness & Quick Decision making for Award money is necessary

While the policy to encourage the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô with a cash award is a step in the right direction, this would be successful only when there is widespread awareness about both the award and the procedure involved. Further, the procedure & timelines to extend cash award to the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô should be followed scrupulously without any delay. Unless these happen, the scheme would not be successful.

345,MP: Good Samaritan scheme aimed at motivating people to help road accident victims comes into force,"A Central scheme aimed at bringing down the fatalities in road accidents by rewarding Good Samaritans who rush the victims to a hospital within the ''golden hour'' has come into force in Madhya Pradesh, a senior official said on Saturday. Under the 'Good Samaritan Scheme,' any person who saves the life of a victim of a road accident by rushing him to a hospital or a trauma centre would be rewarded with Rs 5,000.

‚ÄúThe Centre's Good Samaritan Scheme has come into effect on the day of Dussehra (October 14) in Madhya Pradesh'', State Traffic and Road Safety Additional Director General of Police (ADG) G Janardhan told PTI on Saturday.

He said the scheme was aimed at motivating the general public to help the victims of road accidents in emergencies and inspire and motivate others to save innocent lives.

In August, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways informed Parliament that a total of 3,66,138 road accidents occurred in India during the calendar year 2020, causing 1,31,714 deaths.

The ADG said a Good Samaritan is eligible for the cash prize in case the road accident victim sustains brain, spinal cord injuries or is admitted to the hospital for a minimum of three days or undergoes major surgery.

Janardhan, who is also ADG, MP Police Training and Research Institute (PTRI), said that each Good Samaritan would also receive a certificate of appreciation along with Rs 5,000 in cash for saving the life of a road accident victim.

An individual could be awarded a maximum of five times in a year, he said.

The senior official stressed that the details provided by the person who saves the life of a road accident victim will be used for giving incentives and they won't be used anywhere else.

Explaining the procedure, Janardhan said after a Good Samaritan rushes the victim to the hospital or trauma centre, the doctor concerned will inform the police. Police will write down the details of him in a format and forward it to that district appraisal committee, comprising collector, superintendent of police, chief medical and health officer and Regional Transport Officer (RTO) which will scrutinise the cases and clear the reward.

Asked about the golden hour, the senior police officer said, ‚Äú As per the Motor Vehicle Act's section 2 (12 A), it (golden hour) means the period lasting one hour following a traumatic injury during which there is the highest likelihood of preventing death by providing prompt medical care‚Äù.

In the event of two people saving the life of a road accident victim, the Rs 5,000 reward under this scheme will be divided between them, he said.

‚ÄúIf more than one Good Samaritan saves the life of more than one victim of a fatal accident involving a motor vehicle, the amount of award will be Rs 5,000 per victim saved subject to maximum Rs 5,000 per Good Samaritan,‚Äù he said quoting the circular.

Janardhan further said the state-level appraisal committee comprises the home department additional chief secretary, health secretary and MP transport commissioner besides ADG Traffic & Road safety.

He said there will be ten national-level awards each year for the worthiest Good Samaritans who will be selected from all those who have been awarded during the entire year and they would additionally be given an award of Rs 1 lakh each, a letter of appreciation and a trophy.

346,Kolkata: High-speed EM Bypass bike ride ends in fatal crash for man,"KOLKATA: A 27-year-old man was killed and his 25-year-old wife is battling for life after their bike hit a median divider on EM Bypass , between Metropolitan and Chingrighata crossings near Captain Bheri in the early hours of Sunday. The duo from Garia Nathpara, were headed to the Sreebhumi Puja pandal when the accident happened around 2.10am.The bike was going at a very high speed and the impact flung the couple 15 feet in the air. Indrajit Dey landed on the pointed ends of the median railing. According to cops, the angled ends pierced his neck, severing his head from the body. His wife Subhra‚Äôs condition is extremely critical and she is battling for life at SSKM Trauma Centre.The incident brought to light the rampant traffic violations involving two-wheelers over the weekend. Police records show that Chaturthi alone saw 2,086 two-wheeler prosecutions, 306 of which were for riding rashly and 366 were for not wearing helmets. About 758 bikers were challaned for parking in a way that obstructed vehicle and pedestrian movement. Lalbazar has formed special raid teams that will work after 10pm from Panchami to nab errant bikers.According to Pragati Maidan police and Beliaghata traffic guard, Dey was reportedly speeding despite warning signals put up on that stretch. The Pragati Maidan police has registered a case in this regard.‚ÄúThe spot where the accident took place has a speed radar gun and an electronic speed signage installed to warn riders. There were also red-and-white reflector caps on the median and retro-reflective lights to highlight the lanes. The spot has everything that a modern traffic system requires. Yet, once again, a person had to pay a price for being reckless,‚Äù said an officer.Sources said Indrajit‚Äôs sister and brother-in-law were travelling with them, but they were behind them since they were not speeding. ‚ÄúWe initially sent Subhra to a private hospital off Bypass. But since no emergency bed was available, we shifted her to a private hospital in Salt Lake . A few hours later, her family shifted her to SSKM,‚Äù said an officer.Police said two guard areas through which the Deys had ridden before the accident reported maximum violations by two-wheelers on Saturday. While Garia guard reported 136 cases, Tiljala guard reported 121. These were a shade behind Jorabagan traffic guard that issued 163 challans.Barely 20 minutes after the Chingrighata accident, a truck tried to avoid a rogue biker and rammed the Pragati Maidan police station and Tiljala traffic guard, damaging four police bikes and a patrol vehicle. The police complex, under Tiljala Guard opposite Science City, was saved only because of the guard rails.Officers said these types of accidents have led them to continue block chain raids. ‚ÄúThere were reports that several new riders and motorists are not conversant with the laws and believe cops will not act against them in the festive season. It was also reported from pockets like Beliaghata-Narkeldanga and Anandapur that rogue bikers were racing on deserted roads. Hence, surprise raids are being carried out even during Puja. They will continue this season, leading up to Diwali,‚Äù said an officer.","KOLKATA: A 27-year-old man was killed and his 25-year-old wife is battling for life after their bike hit a median divider on EM Bypass , between Metropolitan and Chingrighata crossings near Captain Bheri in the early hours of Sunday.

Constable Papita has undergone at least seven surgeries, since, and more are underway. She says, ‚ÄúMy left leg was completely motionless. But now there is sensation in my left leg. Though both my legs were severely wounded, the left leg received maximum injuries. I am grateful to my senior officers and the police department, for bearing the expenses of my treatment.‚Äù After an hour long rescue operation, uncertainty still loomed over her fate, as she was pulled out from the remains of the front body of the truck. She continues to be admitted at PGI.

Constable Deepak, who was posted near Sector 36 Beat Box was knocked down by a speedy car. He received critical head injuries. He, too, was rushed to PGI and underwent a head surgery. ‚ÄúDoctors have successfully removed a big blood clot from the head but Deepak is still under observation. His behavior is unusual. Sometimes he starts shouting about his naka duties. Doctors told us that he will be absolutely fine within a couple of days,‚Äù said a close relative of Deepak. He has been admitted in the Neuro-surgical ward.

‚ÄúHarsh is said to be stable but doctors told us that it will at least take a year for Harsh to fully recover from his jaw and bone injuries. Immediately after the incident, Harsh was rushed to GMCH-32. Today, we took him to PGI for his jaw surgery. Harsh‚Äôs treatment has cost around Rs 50,000 so far.

349,Gurgaon: Two men fall to death from flyover after their bike crashes,"A college student and his friend, both suspected to be in their early 20s, died as they fell from the elevated road of IFFCO Chowk U-turn flyover after their motorcycle lost balance and crashed into the flyover re-wall on Sunday morning.

Police said the victims were tossed in the air upon impact and fell on the surface road beneath from a height of at least 20 feet.

Police said the deceased have been identified as Saiyad ur Rehman, a college student from Leh, and his friend, Mohammad Zaid, who hailed from Mandikhera in Mewat.

While Rehman was declared dead on arrival, Zaid died during treatment at a private hospital in Sector 38 on Sunday night, said police.

According to police, the incident took place around 11.30 am, when the victims were about to take a U-turn on the IFFCO Chowk flyover towards the Sukhrali side. Police said they were coming from the Delhi side on a Royal Enfield motorcycle.

A police officer said, ‚ÄúIt is suspected that while navigating the U-turn, the motorcycle lost balance and rammed straight into the 2-2.5 feet re-wall. The motorcycle, being heavy, fell near the re-wall, while the occupants were flung from the flyover upon collision.‚Äù

A team from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) reached the spot and inspected the site of the crash.

An NHAI official, requesting anonymity, said, ‚ÄúOne of the victims fell on a car and the other fell straight on the road. Both suffered serious injuries on their head, back and several parts of the body. Several commuters and traffic police rushed them to a private hospital nearby.‚Äù

Police said they had informed the families of the deceased and they are on their way to Gurgaon. The incident led to traffic congestion for over ten minutes at IFFCO Chowk beneath the flyover. Following the incident, a team from Sector 29 police station rushed to the spot.

‚ÄúThe statement of the families of the victims is yet to be recorded. No case has been registered as of now. The sequence of events is not certain and it is unclear what caused the accident. We will check CCTVs in the area during the probe,‚Äù said a police officer, requesting anonymity.

The bodies have been kept in the mortuary for a post-mortem.

Superintendent of Police Lahaul Spiti Manav Verma told Outlook that it has been raining incessantly. A travel advisory has been issued for the people asking them to avoid journey during next 24 hours .

There has been a road disruption near Nehru Kund on Manali Leh road (National Highway no 3) due to landslides .

It has been continuously raining at Baralacha La Pass ( 15,922 feet) affecting the mobility of the vehicles on Manali Leh road . Only those vehicles used for essential supplies to Leh are allowed to move as the pass has been very slippery for normal mobility of the vehicles.Tourists are not allowed to take-up their journeys .

‚ÄúThere is two to three cms of snow at the Pass‚Äù said SP Manav Verma, adding that Lahaul may experience snow much before the normal timing.

The biggest advantage, however, remains Rohtang Tunnel commissioned a year back by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which is quite a dependable route for all emergency evacuations .

The Meteorological Department, which had issued a yellow warning for two days, said heavy rains would continue to cause landslides and road accidents primarily because of poor visibility caused by thick monsoon fog . Monsoon activity remained large excess in Himachal Pradesh during past week except Chamba, Kinnaur where rainfall was deficient and Lahaul Spiti where rainfall was large deficient.

The temperature in Shimla and a few other hill stations had dropped by 3 to 4 degree C in the past 24 hours.

Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur, who was slated to fly to Bilaspur on official tour, had to cancel the plan because of visibility problem to fly his chopper .Earlier he had to make an emergency landing on Wednesday while return from Dodra-Kawar which is the state‚Äôs remotest and lesser developed area in Shimla across Chanshal Pass .

Three young cops, who were riding a motorbike died. Two of them died on spot in Gagret area of Una this morning as the bike was hit by a truck

Shimla -Parwanoo National Highway has also been experiencing landslides at different places hitting the apple transportation badly. Chandigarh -Manali Highway also faces frequent blockades and road disruptions risking the lives of tourists and other road users .Both National Highways ,however, are open ,said Principal Secretary (Disaster Management ) Onkar Sharma .","Wintry conditions prevailed all over the state on Thursday as result of the rains and snowfall in Lahaul-Spiti valleys.

353,India aims to reduce road accidents by 50 per cent before 2024. Here's the plan,"Union minister Nitin Gadkari has assured that road accident cases in India will go go down by about 50 per cent in the next three years. He has set the target for his Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) to reduce the number of road accidents before 2024 by improving quality of roads as well as safety measures.

Nitin Gadkari's remarks come months after he said that he hopes reduction in deaths in road accidents to go down by 50% before 2025. He had also said that if ""we keep waiting till 2030, then at least 6-7 lakh people will die more due to road accidents"".

Addressing a virtual event organised by industry body Ficci, Nitin Gadkari said, ""Around 1.5 lakh persons die due to road accidents (every year)... My internal target is before 2024, we will reduce deaths and accidents by 50 per cent.""

Currently, a little over 400 people die every day in India due to road accidents. India also records around 1.5 lakh deaths in five lakh road crashes annually. Nitin Gadkari had listed this record as one of the biggest failures of his ministry in the last seven years.

Gadkari laid emphasis on road quality and safety measures on Indian roads to bring down the figures. His ministry is actively working to reduce black spots from Indian roads. Gadkari pointed out that around 50 per cent of road accidents are due to road engineering problems.

Gadkari said his ministry is striving hard to reduce road accident deaths by restructuring and strengthening four 'Es' of road safety -- Engineering (including road and automobile engineering), Economy, Enforcement and Education.

Gadkari also said that insurance companies need to cooperate more with respect to road safety activities to help the ministry to bring down casualties in road crashes. ""Insurance companies are direct beneficiaries of a saved life. Hence, they can extend their cooperation for various road safety activities... but the cooperation from the insurance companies is very negligible, and cooperation from government insurance companies is zero,"" he said.

Gadkari said that there is a shortage of 22 lakh drivers across the country. This has prompted the government to plan 2,000 driving schools, especially in backward districts.","Similar BikesNitin Gadkari's remarks come months after he said that he hopes reduction in deaths in road accidents to go down by 50% before 2025.

355,"Over 27,000 Cattle Died On Railway Tracks Between April 2020 and March 2021","From March 2020 to April 2021, despite trains not running at their full capacity, 27,000 cattle deaths happened on the track between April 2020 and March 2021. The data, which was reported by Indian Express, also showed that between April 2019 and March 2020, over 38,000 cattle were run over by trains. Now that the trains are back at their full capacity, the number of cattle deaths are approaching 3,000 in a month.

The cattle deaths, aside from being a huge loss of animal life and a shock to their owners‚Äô livelihoods, also cause train delays. According to data, cattle deaths have caused delays in 24,000 train trips. Most of the cattle accidents happen in Uttar Pradesh, where it has become a headache for the zonal railways. In a move to tackle this huge problem, authorities are identifying areas with accidents most commonly seen. These ‚Äúvulnerable spots‚Äù include Etawah-Phaphund and Firozabd-Makhhanpur in Kanpur-Tundla sections, Pora-Jalesar near Hathras, Chanderi-Chakeri, near Kanpur; Delwara- Jhakhaura in Jhansi-Lalitpur section and others.

After the identification of these areas, the railway protection forces have urged the locals to stop their cattle from coming close to the railway tracks. ‚ÄúThey are being told that when a case like this happens it is a loss of life and also when the train is forced to be delayed because of a cattle run-over case, the delay may be costly for someone,‚Äù North Central Railway spokesperson Shivam Sharma told The Indian Express.

Trains running over cattle is a problem that is neither new nor going to end soon. While Indian Railways have eliminated all the unmanned level crossings, a big factor in accidents leading to the loss of human life;8,700 people died on railway tracks in 2020. Trains running over humans and animals is a problem that is not easy to solve as fencing around railway tracks everywhere does not always seem feasible. The accidents pose a safety challenge causing damage to assets and delays in train trips.

356,Oxygen cylinder kills South Korean man in MRI accident,"-- A 60-year-old man at a South Korean hospital was killed in an MRI accident when an oxygen cylinder was carried into the scanning suite during his exam, according to news outlet KBS News .

The oxygen cylinder was already on the pallet on which the patient was brought into the suite; during the scan, it was shifted about two meters and was sucked into the device, killing the patient, KBS News reported. The exact cause of the accident is unclear, and police are investigating, the news outlet said. There was no closed-circuit television (CCTV) in the MRI suite, according to KBS.

""When operating the MRI machine, there are usually no metal objects around it because of the strong magnetic force,"" a police official quoted by KBS said. ""The hospital also knew about this but explained that the patient was in critical condition at the time and could not [be taken] off the oxygen cylinder.""

This is the second fatal accident in a month involving MRI. In September, a worker helping to move an MRI scanner from the fourth to the first floor of the University of Utah Hospital in Salt Lake City died when the scanner fell to the ground.

These kinds of clinical MRI accidents just shouldn't be happening, according to MRI safety advocate Tobias Gilk, senior vice president of Radiology-Planning, founder of Gilk Radiology Consultants.

""Despite being a 'never event,' MRI magnetic projectile accidents still continue to happen pretty regularly, and radiology should hang our heads for that,"" he told AuntMinnie.com. ""The fact is that almost nowhere in the world are there actual explicit rules or requirements to follow the long-established best practices that would help prevent exactly this sort of accident.""

The event in Korea echoes a 2018 incident in India, in which a 32-year-old man visiting his mother-in-law in Nair Hospital in Mumbai was killed when an oxygen cylinder he was carrying pulled him into the MRI bore. It was later reported that the metal detector in the room wasn't working properly and that a hospital staff member was on the phone when the accident occurred.

The death in South Korea has occurred 20 years since 6-year old Michael Colombini was killed when a hospital staff member brought a portable oxygen tank into the MRI room; the tank was sucked into the MRI and struck the child in the head. Colombini's death kicked off what has now been a decades-long effort to prevent these kinds of events.

""Given that 2021 is the 20th anniversary of the Michael Colombini accident, we should be deeply embarrassed to see carbon-copy accidents continue to occur decades later,"" Gilk said. ""We know better -- or at least we should know better.""

357,India accounts for 11 per cent of global death in road accidents: World Bank,"With only 1 per cent of the world's vehicles, India accounts for 11 per cent of the global death in road accidents, the highest in the world, according to a report by the World Bank.

The country accounts for about 4.5 lakh road crashes per annum, in which 1.5 lakh people die.

""India tops the world in road crash deaths and injuries. It has 1 per cent of the world's vehicles but accounts for 11 per cent of all road crash deaths, witnessing 53 road crashes every hour; killing 1 person every 4 minutes,"" the report said.

In the last decade, 13 lakh people died and another 50 lakh got injured on Indian roads, it said.

""Considering the under reporting phenomenon and using the crash ratios for the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways crash numbers"", the report estimates the crash costs at Rs 5.96 lakh crore or 3.14 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).

The 2019 World Bank report, titled 'Guide for Road Safety Opportunities and Challenges: Low- and Middle-Income Countries Country Profiles', puts the road crash and serious injury cost estimate at 7.5 per cent of India's GDP or Rs 12.9 lakh crore for 2016. It is more than twice the figure cited by the government at 3 per cent of GDP or Rs 4.3 lakh crore, it added.

A recent study commissioned by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) estimates the socio-economic costs of road crashes at Rs 1,47,114 crore in India, which is equivalent to 0.77 per cent of the country's GDP.

""Considering the under reporting phenomenon and using the crash ratios for MoRTH crash numbers, the same study estimates the crash costs at Rs 5.96 lakh crores i.e. equivalent to 3.14 per cent,"" it said.

At the individual level, road crash injuries and deaths impose a severe financial burden and push entire (non-poor) households into poverty and the already poor into debt.

As per the Ministry, 76.2 per cent of people who are killed in road crashes are in their prime working-age, 18-45 years.

Globally, road traffic injuries (RTIs) are the eighth leading cause of death.

‚ÄòPoor, male road-users of working age, constitute VRU category‚Äô

According to the World Bank, the road crash fatality rate is three times higher in low-income countries compared to high-income countries, and statistics from India further reinforce this global trend.

There is a distinct correlation between socio-economic status and road use patterns in low- and middle-income countries like India and ""poor people are more likely to be involved in a road traffic crash"", it said.

In a country like India, where vulnerable road users are forced to share space with other less vulnerable road users, the income level of an individual has a direct bearing on the mode of transport used.

This in turn further determines the level of risk faced by a particular road user. The report said daily wage workers and workers employed as casual labourers in informal activities are more prone to be defined as vulnerable compared to workers engaged in regular activities.

""It is no coincidence, then, that it is often the poor, especially male road-users of working age, that constitute the category of vulnerable road users (VRUs) in India.

""VRUs bear a disproportionately large burden of road crashes and account for more than half of all road crash deaths and serious injuries in the country,"" it said.

As the world navigates through the Covid-19 pandemic, the road crash pandemic continues to fester the socio-economic landscape in India, the report said.

On Saturday, Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Nitin Gakdari has termed road accident scenario in India more ""dangerous than the Covid-19 pandemic"". He has said there could be a saving of Rs 90 lakh per person by preventing deaths and reducing injuries to minor ones in such incidents.

The Minister had stressed that the accident cost is a tremendous burden to society and the nation, and the estimated cost of a death in a road accident is around Rs 91.16 lakh.

Releasing the World Bank report on 'Traffic Crash Injuries And Disabilities: The Burden on India Society', Gadkari had said that in this alarming scenario, his ministry will formulate policies to protect the interest of the poor and embark on several reformative steps.","With only 1 per cent of the world's vehicles, India accounts for 11 per cent of the global death in road accidents, the highest in the world, according to a report by the World Bank.

The earlier lowest was 1.26 lakh in 2009.The number of road accidents also fell to 3.66 lakh during last year, which was lowest in the past 20 years. The sharp decline in road deaths and crashes was primarily because of restriction on movement of vehicles during to Covid-induced lockdown across the country. In 2019, around 1.51 lakh lives were lost in road crashes in India.Replying to a question in the Lok Sabha, transport minister Nitin Gadkari quoted the reduction in deaths and said his ministry has formulated a multi-pronged strategy to address the issue of road safety based on education, engineering (of roads and vehicles), enforcement and emergency care.The road fatalities had witnessed sharpest decline in the April-June quarter of 2020 calendar year when 20,732 persons were killed compared to 41,032 during the same period in 2019.

361,Integrated Road Accident Database project officially launched in Mizoram,"Aizawl, Oct 13 (PTI) The Integrated Road Accident Database (iRAD) project, a central government initiative that aims to improve road safety, has been officially launched in Mizoram.

State Home Minister Lalchamliana, while launching the programme at state police headquarters on Tuesday, expressed hope that the project would reduce accidents in the state.

""Many road accidents occur due to rash driving. Such mishaps could be avoided if safety measures are taken. Drivers have responsibility for safety of passengers,"" he said.

362,Road safety:IIT researchers working on first-of-its kind geography based smart speed warning system By Gu,"



New Delhi: Researchers at different Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are working on development of a first-of-its kind ""smart speed warning system"" for vehicles which will alert the driver on the basis of road infrastructure and geographical location to avoid over-speeding related crashes.

According to statistics available with the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, about 70 per cent of road fatalities in India occur due to over-speeding.

To minimise such fatalities, the government had mandated that all new cars sold from July 1, 2019, should include a speed governor device that will generate intermittent warning beeps for above 80 kmph and the constant beep for above 120 kmph for drivers. To further reduce damage to lives, the fine for speeding was increased by ten times under the new Motor Vehicles Act of 2019.

However, the researchers at IIT Guwahati and Bombay believe the current speed governing device is a ""one size fits all"" solution and does not have much intelligence and the same system cannot effectively work while driving in hilly terrains, plains or desert areas.

""Our studies revealed the safe speed for a vehicle can significantly vary with changes in road geometry like on sharp or blind curves or hairpin bends. Therefore, there is a need to develop a smart speed warning system incorporating a dynamic and adaptable speed threshold based on upcoming road infrastructure to avoid overspeeding-related crashes,"" Akhilesh Kumar Maurya, Civil Engineering Professor at IIT Guwahati, told PTI.

""Traditional warning systems are based on the fixed speed threshold, however, the concept of a smart warning system is based on upcoming road infrastructure and vehicle location. On approaching curves along a roadway, including blind curves or hairpin bends, vehicles equipped with such a system will warn drivers in advance, which will allow drivers to adopt corrective actions and avoid accidents,"" he added.

The researchers, who are in process of filing a patent for the system, claim that such a system is not available anywhere across the globe.

According to the team, algorithm for the smart speed warning system was developed based on the field data collected from a 45 km stretch of four-lane highway (NH-40) between Jorabat in Assam and Nongpoh in Meghalaya, consisting of 285 horizontal curves. The study section covered a broader range of road geometry (curve radius ranges from 20-800m, curve length varies from 30-244 m and gradient varied from seven per cent to nine per cent.

""We are in the process of analysing data of two-lane undivided highway NH-61 between Mumbai and Malshej Ghat in Maharashtra. We have now completed our pilot studies along four-lane divided highway, NH-160 between Thane and Nashik (Maharashtra) and now planning to collect detailed data very soon,"" Maurya said.

The team plans to conduct similar pilot studies at different highways across the country to get an idea of different geographical locations and present the model ultimately to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).

During the pilot studies of speed prediction model development, the researchers came up with car speed model and HCV and LCV speed model.

According to Avijit Maji, Associate Professor at IIT Bombay's Civil Engineering department, researchers have used operating speed of vehicles as one of the surrogate measures for safety evaluation of horizontal curves

""Now, the 85th percentile speed of vehicles in free-flow condition is widely considered as the operating speed. However, the geometric features of highways are designed on the basis of design speed. Some studies pointed out that the design speed might be represented by 95th to 98th percentile speed of vehicles in free-flow condition,"" he described in a paper published in the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) journal.

""Drivers in developing nations are not well disciplined and often drive solely based on their perception of the road geometry. Hence, the 98th percentile vehicle speed can be useful in evaluating safety of a highway section in such country. Now, the available vehicle speed prediction models vary widely. Differences in driver behaviour and highway geometry might be the reasons for these variations,"" he added.

Another research scholar from the team asserted that studies show that the decision-making process and driver performance greatly depends on situational awareness.

""Drivers intend to operate vehicles at safe speed based on the roadway geometric features. These features are characterised by gradient, horizontal curvature, length of curves and tangent sections, superelevation, etc. Perceptive and consistent geometric characteristics of the roadway can ease the decision making burden and thus minimise driver error.

""So far, majority of the studies on geometric design consistency are conducted on isolated curve sections in plain terrain for traffic with strong lane discipline. The effect of gradient is not significant in these terrains. Further, the driving behaviour of traffic with weak lane discipline is not represented in these studies,"" he described.","New Delhi: Researchers at different Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are working on development of a first-of-its kind ""smart speed warning system"" for vehicles which will alert the driver on the basis of road infrastructure and geographical location to avoid over-speeding related crashes.

364,"India witnessed 4.49 lakh road accidents, 1.51 lakh deaths in 2019","By PTI

NEW DELHI: A total of 4,49,002 road accidents occurred in India in 2019, causing 1,51,113 deaths, despite the number of such road mishaps coming down during the year when compared with 2018, Parliament was informed on Monday.

In a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said that road accidents are occurring due to multiple causes such as over speeding, drunken driving, consumption of alcohol, driving on wrong side/lane, indiscipline, fault of the driver of motor vehicle, use of mobile phones during driving etc.

The number of road accidents in 2018 was 4,67,044 and deaths were recorded at 1,51,417.

Gadkari said his ministry has implemented a scheme for undertaking publicity measures and awareness campaigns on road safety to create awareness among road users through the electronic media, print media, NGOs etc.

He added that high priority has been taken to identify and rectify black spots (accident prone spots) on national highways.

Gadkari noted that safety standards for automobiles have been improved and the ministry has notified fitment of speed limiting devices on all transport vehicles.

Replying to a separate question, he said the government does not collect data on removal of liquor shops situated along the national highways as this is a state subject.

The Supreme Court of India has issued directions regarding stopping the grant of licences for sale of liquor along national and state highways and over a distance of 500 metres from the outer edge of the national or state highways or of a service lane along the highway.

""As per the orders of Hon'ble Supreme Court, the ministry has requested all the state governments and UTs, from time to time, to take necessary action for implementation of the order(s) of Hon'ble Supreme Court.

""Further, Section 185 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 provides for punishment of imprisonment or fine or both for the offence of drunken driving cases,"" he said.

Stating that the ministry deals with the matters related to development of national highways and providing access to properties situated along the national highways, he said the ministry has no control on the usage of and business run in these properties located beyond the Right of Way (ROW) of national highways.

366,"With 53 road crashes per hour, road accidents in India continue to be highest in world","With 53 road crashes per hour, road accidents in India continue to be highest in world

We have known for quite some time now that the state of road safety in India is abysmal, to say the least. Come to think of it, the horrifying state of things in the context of road safety in India has been for the world to see. And now we have yet another reminder of just how deadly roads are -- this time from the World Bank. Yep, the World Bank recently released a new report that makes some interesting notes about India. For starters, the report noted that even though India is home to just 1 per cent of the world's vehicles, we still account for 11 per cent of the global road accident deaths. This is the highest in the world, by the way. It offers an even more grim number: 53 road accidents occur in India every our, killing one person every 4 minutes.

The World Bank's 2019 report, Guide for Road Safety Opportunities and Challenges: Low- and Middle-Income Countries Country Profiles, added that 13 lakh people died and another 50 lakh people have sustained injuries on Indian roads just in the last decade. Wait, there's more -- the report, factoring in the under reporting phenomenon and the crash ratios for the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways crash numbers, estimates the crashes cost the country a staggering a sum.

Road accidents in India: The cost we pay

What's even more interesting to note is that this report says the road crash and serious injury cost estimate for 2016 stood at 7.5 per cent of India's GDP or ‚Çπ12.9 lakh crore. This is more than two-folds the figure cited by the Indian government -- i.e. 3 per cent of GDP or ‚Çπ4.3 lakh crore. Speaking in the context of individuals, road accident injuries and deaths result in crippling financial burden and push non-poor households into poverty and the already poor into debt.

Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways, recently described India's road accident situation as more ""dangerous than the COVID-19 pandemic"". He added that the prevention of deaths and a reduction in injuries during road accidents can have far-reaching financial benefits as well. Gadkari said the estimated cost of a death in a road accident is about ‚Çπ91.16 lakh.","With 53 road crashes per hour, road accidents in India continue to be highest in worldWe have known for quite some time now that the state of road safety in India is abysmal, to say the least.

The situation is alarming... there are more deaths than in COVID-19...It is more dangerous than COVID-19,"" Gadkari said terming the World Bank report an eye-opener.In India cost per seriously injured person comes at Rs 3.64 lakh while cost per minor injured person stands at Rs 77, 938 and the cost per death is estimated at Rs 91.16 lakh, he said.""So death cost is 100 times more than injury cost. It shows that if we succeed in preventing deaths in a road accident and restrict the life of accident victims to minor injuries only, we can save around Rs 90 lakh per person,"" the minister said addressing the event.""We needed to change law and make special policies. Accident cost as a tremendous burden to society and nation. There are lots of lapses in the legal system, police system. We need to protect the poor,"" he said adding that policy interventions are on the anvil apart from a number of steps, already initiated by his ministry.Around 70 per cent of deaths are in the working-age group of 18 to 45 years old while India accounts for 415 deaths per day in road accidents.Emphasising road safety audits, besides audit of detailed project reports, engineering plans and schemes pertaining to the injured, the minister said various audits can correct deficiencies causing accidents.Earlier, 40,000 km of highways have been brought under auditing.The minister said IITs and engineering colleges could take up highway stretches for road safety audit with some financial aid while third-party road safety audits will help in finding engineering faults and correcting them.Emphasising that his ministry was one such ministry which did not believe in protecting the wrong-doers and was transparent, the minister said there is a need that DPRs should be proof-checked and revised by competent authorities, third-party agencies, and educational institutions before implementation.He urged states to replicate Tamil Nadu model which could reduce road accidents by 38 per cent and deaths by 54 per cent and added 78 per cent of road accident deaths are of two-wheeler riders, bicyclists and pedestrians and protection and safety of these vulnerable road user groups is the foremost priority of the Centre.Gadkari further said the chairman of the National Road Safety Council will be announced soon as this body will be responsible for collecting accident data and suggesting measures to further reduce road accidents.Stressing that 70 per cent of accident deaths In India are due to over-speeding, the minister said fitness check of all vehicles has been mandated through Automated Vehicle Inspection and Certification (I&C) centres.Gadkari also said it is essential that automobile manufacturers should further enhance safety features.Broadly, the Report says that road accidents are a tremendous burden to society and the nation and states and reducing accident deaths and injuries can boost income growth and large welfare gains can be achieved from proven cost-effective road safety interventions.The minister said road accident deaths and injuries strike down prime working-age adults in low and middle-income countries and added that accidents are a public health issue and challenge in countries like India.Gadkari said the government is working with the World Bank on various projects, one of which is to streamline the road crash database that is iRAD.Pointing out that one of the key findings of the report is that the number of accident deaths is double in poor families as compared to rich ones, he said it is very important to have a streamlined and robust and accessible legal, insurance and healthcare ecosystem.The minister said that recommendations of the report on the safety of vulnerable road users, cashless treatment, improvement of civic and health infrastructures, penetration and compensation mechanism of insurance, post-crash response ecosystem and integration of stake-holders would help in revising the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act 2019 and Motor Vehicle rules.The World Bank report comes even as the country is observing an extended first-ever ‚ÄúRoad Safety Month‚Äù currently to build awareness of road safety.","""For Government, each life is precious whether that is from poor or rich family, urban or rural area, male or female and at any level of society.

368,"Over 27,000 cattle deaths on tracks in Covid year","Cows continued to die by the thousands on India‚Äôs railway tracks even during the peak of the pandemic last year when the country ran trains sparingly.

The Railways recorded more than 27,000 cases of cattle being run over between April 2020 and March 2021. The numbers climbed up month after month as more trains started returning to service.

A little over 38,000 cows were run over in the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù year before the pandemic, April 2019 to March 2020.

Now, with almost all trains back in service, the number has started rising again, clocking close to 3,000 per month since April this year. Between April and September, over 20,000 cows have been run over by trains.

In 2020, Railways shut down all passenger train services on March 22. Data show only 440 cows were run over by trains in April 2020, at the height of the first nationwide lockdown. Goods trains continued to run as per demand in an effort to keep essential supplies going.

Thereafter, regulated train services started with Shramik Specials for the stranded migrants from May 1. In May that year, the number of cattle deaths rose to 1,000.

The Railways began a graded resumption of services across India from June 1, 2020, bringing back 100 special trains at select routes. By the end of July, the number of cattle deaths on the tracks rose to 2,000 a month.

It has been returning to pre-Covid levels ever since.

Even during the peak of the second Covid-19 wave in April-May this year, around 2,600 cows died on the tracks each month. Around 4,200, the highest in a month, died this August, as per data.

Since April, more than 24,000 train trips have been delayed because of cases of cattle being run over. With six months for the financial year to end, zonal railways are planning new strategies to tackle what is a growing headache.

In Uttar Pradesh, which witnesses most of these cases, authorities are identifying stretches where such accidents are most commonly seen.

Stretches like Firozabd-Makhhanpur, Etawah-Phaphund in Tundla-Kanpur sections; between Chanderi-Chakeri, near Kanpur; Pora-Jalesar near Hathras; Delwara- Jhakhaura in Jhansi-Lalitpur section; in the Mathura-Kosikalaan section and in the Agra-Dholpur section, are zeroed in as ‚Äúvulnerable spots‚Äù.

Railway Protection Force teams and other officials have asked village heads in these places to stop livestock from coming close to railway tracks.

‚ÄúCounselling them and enlisting the help of the village pradhan and others is one of the strategies.They are being told that when a case like this happens it is a loss of life and also when the train is forced to be delayed because of a cattle run-over case, the delay may be costly for someone‚Ä¶ Besides, it is a loss of a life,‚Äù said Shivam Sharma, the spokesperson for Allahabad-based North Central Railway.

A perennial problem

Cattle being run over by trains has been a perennial problem for Indian Railways. Each such case damages assets, delays trains and poses a safety challenge. Since fencing of tracks is not always possible everywhere, authorities face a challenge of coming up with lasting solutions.","The Railways recorded more than 27,000 cases of cattle being run over between April 2020 and March 2021.

369,Using umbrella during rain can get you fined- Know about new rule,"As per a new rule established in the state of Kerala, people will have to pay a fine if they are carrying an umbrella during the rains while travelling during traffic. Fret not; this rule is only applicable for those who are travelling on a two-wheeled vehicle in Kerala.

As bizarre as this rule sounds, it will keep all the passengers and nearby pedestrians safe during the rainy season. People travelling via a bike are often seen using an open umbrella while they are moving through traffic, which can be very unsafe.

As Kerala receives a lot of rainfall, many people travelling on bikes and scooters were seen using umbrellas while driving. This lead to a dramatic rise in road accidents during the rains in Kerala, thus, this new rule has been imposed.

Keeping all these accidents in mind, the Transport Commissioner of Kerala has written a letter to all the traffic authorities to restrict travellers on two-wheelers from using umbrellas while driving their vehicles. The authorities have stated that using an umbrella while winds are moving at high speed is very dangerous, and can lead the person to get misbalanced and falling off.

Last month, a 52-year-old woman in Kerala fell off a motorcycle and injured herself while trying to open an umbrella on the moving vehicle. The woman, who was travelling with her son, suffered serious head injuries due to this incident, and later succumbed to them.

In view of these accidents, the traffic police in Kerala will keep a close watch on all those travelling by two-wheelers and challan will be issued if they don‚Äôt follow the newly implemented rule.","Fret not; this rule is only applicable for those who are travelling on a two-wheeled vehicle in Kerala.

Staff Reporter :

Justice (retd) Abhay Sapre, Chairman of Road Safety Committee constituted by the Supreme Court, holds meeting in city and asks officials to make efforts to reduce road accidents

‚ÄúViolation of speed limit is the main reason behind most road mishaps. As many as 69 per cent of road accidents happen because of this. Hence, Police Department and Transport Department need to implement the rules in this regard strictly and create deterrence against violation. This will help reduce road accidents and save lives,‚Äù said Justice (retd) Abhay Sapre, Road Safety Committee constituted by the Supreme Court. Justice Abhay Manohar Sapre was speaking at a meeting of the committee, at Hotel Pride here on Sunday.

Addressing the officers, Justice Sapre observed that loss of life and financial loss incurred due to road accident had long-term impacts on the lives of family members of accident victims. Hence, the issue of road accidents should be handled with sensitivity. He also spoke on measures to be taken to reduce the number of road accidents and number of fatalities. ‚ÄúThe quality of road construction should be ensured.

The works relating to ‚ÄòBlack Spots‚Äô should be completed expeditiously, and quality check should be carried out after completion of work to assess if number of accidents at these spots came down, he added. Justice Sapre emphasised upon the need for making the people aware of various aspects of road safety by way of effective co-ordination among agencies concerned. The persons injured in road mishaps must get medical treatment immediately, and other related actions should be taken expeditiously. Government may construct good roads, have speed-breakers, traffic sign-boards at appropriate locations. However, he observed, ‚ÄúIt is for the people to wear helmet, use seat-belt, not go wrong side, not ride/drive in an inebriated condition, and follow self-discipline as well as traffic rules.‚Äù He appealed to the agencies concerned to implement awareness drives regularly.","‚Äò69% of road mishaps due to violation of speed limit‚ÄôJustice (retd) Abhay Sapre interacting with officers including Dr Bhushankumar Upadhyay, Additional DG (Highways); Aswathi Dorje, Joint Commissioner of Police, and others, during a meeting held here on Sunday.

372,"Kerala Floods: Downpour Kills 35 in South, Central Kerala; More Rains Forecast Later This Week | The Weather Channel - Articles from The Weather Channel | weather.com","Rescue and relief operation in Kerala on October 17 (Indian Navy / Jipson Sikhera / BCCL, Kerala)

October 18, Monday : Even in the second half of October, the monsoon rains have continued to linger with a few strong spells across many parts of the country, especially over the southern peninsula. Over the weekend, a low-pressure area over the southeast Arabian Sea and adjoining coast continued to interact with the system over the Bay of Bengal, causing widespread rains with isolated very heavy falls across Kerala‚Äôs southern and central districts.

As per the latest updates, resultant flash floods and landslides have claimed 35 lives so far, with at least 13 deaths in Kottayam and nine in Idukki. Landslides have claimed maximum lives compared to any other rain-related accidents.

Saturday was the rainiest spell, with Peermade in the Idukki district recording a maximum of a whopping 292 mm within 24 hours. Idukki, Kolam and Ernakulam experienced high amounts of rainfall exceeding 200 mm, said the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Again, over the last 24 hours till Monday morning, more than 100 mm rains were recorded in districts like Thrissur.

Kerala has received a total of 445 mm rainfall so far this month, which is more than double the normal of 184 mm for this time of the year. A maximum of more than 500 mm rains has been recorded at Idukki, Kozhikode, and Pathanamthitta since October 1.

Fresh spell of heavy rains from Wednesday

Five-days rainfall accumulation forecast for Kerala from Wednesday to Sunday (TWC Met Team)

Adding to the woes, a fresh spell of easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal will likely bring widespread rainfall with isolated heavy rains over Kerala and Tamil Nadu between Wednesday and Friday this week. The IMS also forecasts isolated very heavy rains over Kerala on Thursday and Friday.

Accordingly, almost all the districts across the state have been kept under a yellow watch from Wednesday to Friday. The alert level implies ‚Äòbe updated‚Äô about the possible adverse weather conditions.

‚ÄúWhile the Bay of Bengal low-pressure system moved west-north-westwards across north coastal Andhra Pradesh and adjoining south Odisha coast, the Arabian Sea system moved east-south-eastwards. And finally, the Bay of Bengal's low-pressure system moved towards Telangana and the Arabian Sea system reached the Kerala coast on Saturday. As a result, there was maximum rainfall activity over Kerala under the influence of this low-pressure system,"" said Mrutyunjay Mahapatra, Director General of the IMD, explaining the cause for rainfall over the weekend.

As some parts of the state reported more than 150 mm of rainfall within a few hours, many have started to speculate if this was indeed a cloudburst event. However, the IMD has not confirmed any such event in any part of the state.

Authorities respond on a war footing

Advertisement While chairing a meeting of high-level officials to discuss the ongoing flood situation, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said: ""At the moment, 184 relief camps have been set up in which all essential items are there"". Around 4,000 people are now lodged at various camps in Idukki, Kottayam, Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha districts.

On Monday, the Dam Safety Authority issued an orange alert for the Idukki dam, followed by a red warning for the Kakki reservoir in the Pathanamthitta district. Vijayan on Monday said an expert committee would take a decision to open dams, and the District Collector will ensure that people living in vulnerable areas are evacuated to safety.

Since the century's biggest floods in 2018, Kerala has seen heavy rains and flash floods almost every monsoon season.

On Sunday, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said the Central government would provide all assistance to Kerala to overcome the flood situation and that the government is monitoring the situation closely. The Kerala government has announced a financial compensation of Rs 4 lakh to the families of all deceased victims.

Rescue and relief operations are being carried out at Kottayam and Idukki districts by the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Navy, Army and the Air Force.

373,Common myths & underlying data behind road accidents in India,"While things seem very bleak at this moment, historical data puts this in an entirely different light.

BHPian Stribog recently shared this with other enthusiasts.

There are many preconceived ""notions"" that many of us have on road accidents. A few I see often in many threads in this forum itself:

2-wheelers are inherently unsafe

The converse, cars are safer

Trucks and buses are doom-bringers

And a lot more.

Well, let us look at the numbers behind accidents in India. Morbid yes, but relevant also IMO. MoRTH publishes data annually (like pretty much all central govt. bureaus like say NCRB) which can be a treasure trove for those who like number crunching.

At the outset though, there is no escaping the fact that Indian roads are fatal in absolute numbers.

Some Meta stats - All data are from the Sept report, covering 2019-20 (no report has been published thus far this year, but would be interesting to see the impact COVID had on accidents)

India, ranks 1st in the number of road accident deaths across the 199 countries reported in the World Road Statistics, 2018 followed by China and US. As per the WHO Global Report on Road Safety 2018, India accounts for almost 11% of the accident related deaths in the World A total of 4,49,002 road accidents have been reported by States and Union Territories (UTs) in the calendar year 2019, claiming 1,51,113 lives and causing injuries to 4,51,361 persons. Normalised to population, you have. A 0.05% chance of being involved in an accident with a 0.01% chance of it being fatal. In percentage terms, in 2019, the number of accidents have decreased by 3.86 percent, persons killed has decreased by 0.20% and injuries have decreased by 3.85 percent over that of the previous year i.e. 2018. Road accident severity measured by the number of persons killed per 100 accidents has seen an increase of 1.3 percentage points in 2019 over the previous year National Highways & State Highways which account for about 5% of the total road length accounts for a disproportionately large share of accident related deaths of 61%. Other Roads which constitute about 95 % of the total road length were responsible for the balance 39% deaths respectively Over-speeding accounts for the maximum share of road accident and road accident deaths (ranging between 63% and 73% for accidents and between 62% and 70% for road accident deaths) on all the categories of National Highways and thus follows the trend seen on all India basis. To be safe (as much as possible) 4+5 should be combined. Stick to speed limits on NH & SH, follow defensive driving and statistically chances of your being involved in an accident will drop significantly. The share of males in number of total accident deaths was 86% while the share of females hovered around 14% in 2019. This reflects both the number of male drivers (though we don't have official data on the number / % of female drivers) and IMO aggressive driving by men.

Historical Perspective:

While things seem very bleak at this moment, historical data puts this in an entirely different light. There has been a drastic reduction in accidents, fatalities and injuries starting 1970 on though the number of vehicles on the road has exploded.

Some top-line numbers:

1970 - Vehicle Density (VD) 1.18 (number of vehicles / km of road), Fatality Rate (FR) 103.5 (this is the number of fatal accidents per 10,000 pop)

1980 - VD 3.03, FR 53.1

1990 - VD 9.65, FR 28.3

2000 - VD 14.73, FR 16.2

While our vehicle density went up 4.5X from 1980 to 2000, our FR dropped by 70%

2010 - VD 27.88, FR 10.5

2018 - VD 39.78, FR 6.2 (data for 2019 not available when this report was published)

From 2010-18, our VD went up by 42%, but our FR dropped by 40%.

If these values are projected into the future, our accident and FR might just meet the Stockholm commitment of halving road accidents and fatalities by 2030.

Coming up in part 2, would be vehicle-wise accident and fatality rates. Let us see if the urban legends hold up or remain that, urban legends.

Here's what BHPian RedTerrano had to say on the matter:

I cannot help but wonder, how the authorities arrived at the conclusion that over speeding caused accidents leading to death. How many speed traps or radar guns have been deployed on the highways? Is any data available for this? How about non-fatal accidents on the highways? How many caused due to lack of lane demarcation, lack or road signs, unpainted speed breakers, road blockages set up by local RTA (without proper signage or reflectors)? Any data available on this? Also, is there any data available for German autobahns where there is no speed limit? How do those fatalities fare as compared to Indian highways?

Here's what BHPian PearlJam had to say on the matter:

Why do you think this is a preconceived notion? Rest of the things being the same, even a gentle hit to a two wheeler traveling at 30 KMPH could cause the rider to fall. Or, there could be a small oil patch on the road that causes the rider to skid and fall. They could get crushed by other vehicles. They could have head injuries if the helmet was improper. They could be affected by sudden winds. A car driver would most likely remain safe, even in a Maruti 800, in the same situation. This is just one example. I'm not even talking of any safety equipment. You have given a few numbers that some show absolute numbers and a few percentages. This is no way ""concludes"" your points (1) and (2). For example, there are no numbers on 2 wheelers vs cars on our roads. There are no rough average numbers on the distances travelled (or time spent on the road) by 2 wheelers vs cars. There are no numbers on whether they drive/ride in the cities or on the highways. There are no numbers on the average speeds. There is no mention of day/night driving/riding. I see the numbers as meaningless and incomplete. Am I missing something here?

375,Watch | All about road accidents in India,"A video explainer on India's battle with road accidents in numbers

Road accidents are the leading cause of death among people in the 5-29 age-group worldwide according to a World Health Organisation report.

More than 1.35 million lives are lost each year and 50 million people sustain injuries. Globally, road accidents are the tenth leading cause of death.

India accounts for about 5 lakh road accidents annually, one of the highest in the world, in which about 1.5 lakh people die and another 3 lakh become crippled.

Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways V.K. Singh has said that around 71% of 4.49 lakh road accidents in India in 2019 were due to over speeding.

According to experts, the main causes of road accidents in India are rapid urbanisation, poor safety, lack of enforcement, distracted drivers, influence of drugs or alcohol, speeding and a failure to wear seat-belts or helmets.

There has been a 10% reduction in the number of deaths caused due to accidents in the country since the passage of the amended Motor Vehicles Act, said Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari.

He said the government has pledged to reduce 50% accidents in the next five years, and India is a signatory to this at the World Safety Conference held in Sweden recently.

Among various steps being taken to reduce accidents, the government proposes to open 1,000 driving schools in the country.

In 2020, the government launched a central accident database management system known as the Integrated Road Accident Database that will help in analysing causes of road crashes and in devising safety interventions to reduce such accidents in the country.","A video explainer on India's battle with road accidents in numbersRoad accidents are the leading cause of death among people in the 5-29 age-group worldwide according to a World Health Organisation report.

Besides, more than 40,000 km of roadways are being audited for safety.

378,"National highways in south account for most road accidents, black spots; UP, Tamil Nadu top among states","Given the regional disparities in the national highway network in India and the concentration of traffic-related injuries to a few states or regions, a localised approach to road safety may be more suited

In India, every year more people die of road traffic injuries or road accidents than of malaria, tuberculosis or HIV. In 2019 alone, over 1.51 lakh people died due to injuries caused by road accidents. This was more than the total deaths caused by the three diseases combined.

In 2019, malaria killed 7,700 people, the human immunodeficiency virus killed 58,960 while tuberculosis claimed 79,144 lives.

The situation, however, seems to be improving. Between 2018 and 2020 India witnessed a drop in road traffic injuries. While 1,40,843 road accidents were reported in national highways and expressways in 2018, they fell to 1,37,191 in 2019. The number of road accidents reduced further to 1,16,496 in 2020 (provisional data). The reduction in road traffic injuries was witnessed across all the seven major regions - south, north, east, west, north-west, north-east and central India.

NHs and expressways in south report maximum road traffic injuries

However, government data show that road accidents are concentrated in a few problem states such as Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, or regions such as south India.

As per the 2020 provisional data, south India (includes the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Goa, and the UTs of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, and Puducherry) accounted for 41.6 percent or 48,476 of the total 1,16,496 road traffic injuries. The figures were 59,280 in 2018 and 57,457 in 2019.

In contrast, all other regions, north, west, east, central, north-west and north-east reported less than 15,000 road accidents in 2020.

Region States Year 2018 Year 2019 Year 2020 South Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Goa, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Puducherry 59280 57457 48476 North Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand 17014 16843 14219 North West Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi and Rajasthan 18307 17118 13867 Central Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh 13962 14251 13296 East West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand 13910 14285 12884 West Gujarat, Maharashtra, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu 13352 11871 9735 North East Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura 5018 5366 3986 Grand Total 140843 137191 116496 SOURCE: Press Information Bureau, Government of India

Among other regions, in 2002, north (Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand) reported the second-highest (14,219) road accidents in 2020. The north-west region (Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi and Rajasthan), which reported the second-highest road traffic injuries in 2019 at 17,718 reduced the numbers to 13,867 in 2020.

It's to be noted that south India also accounts for the maximum length of national highways at 24,098 kilometres as of 2017.

But then, among states, Tamil Nadu in the south reported 15,269 road accidents, the highest in 2020. The southern state had 4,946 kilometres of national highways as of 2017. Uttar Pradesh, which had 8,712 kilometres of national highways (second highest in 2017), accounted for 13,695 road traffic injuries and Karnataka (6,762 kilometres of NHs in 2017) reported 11,230 road accidents. These three states have contributed the maximum number of road accidents in 2018 as well as 2019.

However, Maharashtra, which accounted for the largest network of national highways at 15,437 kilometres in 2017, reported 9,355, 8,360 and 6,501 in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

What's the solution?

Reducing deaths due to road traffic injuries in India has been a major focus of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) under Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari.

Stating the need for an engineering-driven approach to reduce road traffic injuries in India, the Union minister in June 2021 had said that 50 percent of the road accidents in India are due to road engineering problems. He added that the government has taken special initiatives to identify and improve black spots.

The ministry, according to a report published in June this year, is allocating ‚Çπ14,000 crores for states, the National Highways Authority of India and other stakeholders to remove black spots under a scheme sanctioned by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

On Thursday, PIB issued a statement by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH), stating that it has already identified 5,803 black spots on national highways based on accident and fatality data between 2015 and 2018 in 30 states and UTs.

The ministry said that temporary measures have been taken on 5,167 black spots and 2,923 Black spots have been permanently rectified.

What are black spots?

In transportation, a black spot is not a literal spot on the road, but a short stretch of the road usually of about 500 metres in length, which is prone to accidents.

As per MORTH, a stretch of road is termed a black spot if ""five accidents involving serious injuries/fatalities or ten fatalities took place during the past three calendar years"".

However, ""some times a single accident can have multiple fatalities, hence a number of fatal/grievous accidents at the same location is a better indicator of problematic road/road environment (ie, black spot) than the number of fatalities"".

Why are they crucial?

Identification and rectification of black spots on national highways and state highways (SHs) have been one of the dimensions of India's policies to reduce road traffic crashes. The rectification of black spots is done using short-term remedies such as installing cautionary road signs and markings, transverse bar markings, rumble strips and solar blinkers, etc, as well as long-term remedies such as providing flyover, underpasses, foot-over bridges, service roads, etc, wherever required.

The MORTH statement on Thursday said that some of these steps are being taken to rectify black spots. Besides, the NHAI, which is primarily responsible for constructing and managing national highways in India (NHIDCL and PWDs of states also manage them) has delegated financial power of up to Rs 50 crore to its regional officers to carry out rectification of black spots including land acquisition without sending files to NHAI headquarter for approval.

The ministry also said that it is taking traffic calming measures such as traffic warning signs, delineators, road studs, bar markings, humps at approach roads, etc, at vulnerable sections of National Highways to reduce road accident fatalities.

Is there a connection between black spots and accidents?

Earlier in the story, we looked at the states and regions which account for the maximum number of road accidents in national highways and expressways, now let us take a look at the concentration of black spots in the national highways and expressways from 30 states and UTs, data for which has been collected by MORTH's Transport Research Wing (TRP).

Region States Black spots South Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Goa, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Puducherry 2,493 East West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand 992 North West Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi and Rajasthan 967 North Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand 459 Central Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh 445 West Gujarat, Maharashtra, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu 304 North East Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura 143 Grand Total 5,803 SOURCE: Press Information Bureau, Government of India

As it's clear from the data above, national highways and expressways in south India account for the maximum number 2,493 of black spots -- nearly 43 percent of the 5,803 identified by the TRP.

While the concentration of black spots in other regions does not follow the same pattern as road accidents (check table at the top), the concentration of black spots is located majorly in five regions -- south, east, north-west, north and central -- which also reported the maximum number of road accidents.

Going beyond the national highways, expressways

India reported a total of 4,49,002 accidents in the year 2019. These accidents led to 1,51,113 accidental deaths and 4,51,361 accidental injuries. Based on recent data released by MORTH, of the nearly 4.5 lakh accidents that took place in 2019, 1,37,191 or 30.5 percent occurred in national highways and expressways.

These figures are indeed a matter of concern for the MORTH which owns the national highways, especially given the low distribution of the national highways -- the NHs accounted for just 1.94 percent of India's total roads as of 2017. But the situation on the flipside (other roads) seems just as alarming.

The remaining roads -- state highways (2.97 percent), district (9.94 percent), rural (70.65 percent) and urban roads (8.93 percent) and project roads (5.58 percent) -- are likely to be where the remaining 69.5 percent road accidents might be taking place.

While the MORTH's focus on improving black spots in national highways and expressways is a crucial initiative that needs to be completed on priority. Any initiative to reduce road accidents in India will be incomplete if it fails to include the state highways, district roads, rural roads.

MORTH didn't release any data related to road safety initiatives on these roads on Thursday.

Also, given the existing regional disparities in the national highway network in India, and the concentration of traffic-related injuries to a few states or regions, a localised approach may be more suited.","While 1,40,843 road accidents were reported in national highways and expressways in 2018, they fell to 1,37,191 in 2019.

379,"In India, six two-wheeler riders die every hour in road accidents","As two-wheelers become more popular in the absence of public transport, the number of road accidents involving these is also growing. More than a third (37%) of those killed in road accidents in 2019 were two-wheeler riders, noted a Ministry of Road Transport and Highways‚Äô report published in October this year.

More crashes and deaths are resulting from faulty licensing laws, no training, poor roads and unsafe helmets. Just correct helmet use could reduce the risk of fatal injuries by 42% and head injuries by 69%, a World Health Organization report said.

India needs stricter licensing laws and must ensure the use of proper helmets through effective communication and fines, experts told IndiaSpend. Mandatory and proper training for riding and handling two-wheelers is a must, as is an overall improvement in road infrastructure. Also, India must bolster public transport in order to reduce traffic.

Bike sales grow with income

As the gross national income per capita rises, the number of two-wheelers also increases. The poorer the country, the higher the growth, according to The United Nations Motorcycle Helmet Study published in 2016. An exponential, growth in a country‚Äôs two-wheeler fleet might result in a rapid increase in the number of motorcycle crashes.

India witnessed a rapid growth in per capita incomes in the last decade, which also led to people buying more vehicles ‚Äì particularly two-wheelers ‚Äì according to a study by the Institute for Social and Economic Change, Bangalore. India‚Äôs per capita income grew by 28% between 2013 and 2017 while two-wheeler registrations increased by 46% (compared to 44% overall new vehicle registrations) over the same period.

Last year, 2.12 crore two-wheelers were sold in India and the annual sales are projected to reach 2.66 crore units by 2025 at 2.6% growth rate, according to UnivDatos .

Alongside the increase in income and the subsequent rise in the number of vehicles, India also witnessed concrete or tarred surface road growth of 4.18% from 1951-2018 . However, all this has not been accompanied by a corresponding improvement in regulation and regulatory infrastructure necessary to protect and educate vulnerable road users, pointed out experts.

There is barely any education on road safety in India, said Vir Nakai, 41, a Mumbai-based motorcyclist and brand strategist for bike manufacturers.

‚ÄúSafety is not high on our agenda... whether it is issuing driving licences or formulating and enforcing traffic rules,‚Äù said Nakai, who has been riding motorcycles across the country for over two decades. ‚ÄúThat is the main reason why we have to deal with hazards like parked vehicles on main roads, people riding and driving on the wrong side, little regard for traffic lights and complete lack of lane discipline. Motorcyclists are a small thing on the road and no one cares about them.‚Äù

Together, two-wheelers and pedestrians account for 54% of accident-related deaths in India and are the most vulnerable category in line with global trends, according to the ministry report . While 37% of road accident deaths (56,136) ‚Äì or six every hour, on average ‚Äì involved two-wheelers, pedestrians made up 17% and cyclists 3%. There were 449,002 road accidents leading to 151,113 deaths, making Indian roads the deadliest in the world, the report noted. India accounts for 11% of the global road accident fatalities.

Mobility and motorcycles

Motorcycles and scooters, given their price-point and availability, are a convenient alternative to the inadequate public transport that exists outside of the big cities, said Nakai. The average commute time for surveyed two-wheeler riders in Pune was just about 30 minutes while commuting by public transport typically took much longer, found a 2014 research by World Resources Institute .

‚ÄúScooters or two-wheelers are seen more as family vehicles in rural and semi-urban areas,‚Äù said Bhargab Maitra, a professor of infrastructure design at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. ‚ÄúYou will see that bike sales are higher in these areas but enforcement of traffic laws is a lot more lax.‚Äù

‚ÄúMost places of work are in cities while the workers tend to stay in the suburbs as housing prices within the city are too high for many to afford,‚Äù said Tej Prakash Sinha, head of emergency medicine of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.

While cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata have metro and local train services and others such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai are developing their metro coverage, most of India does not have proper public transport services. Hence people are forced to travel long distances daily and bikes make the commute faster and easier, he added.

Poor licensing laws, little training

Vehicles driven by untrained and unqualified drivers are a serious traffic hazard. Road accidents involving drivers without a valid driving license increased from 37,585 in 2018 to 44,358 in 2019, an increase of 18%, and accounted for 9.9% of the total accidents, the transport ministry data showed.

‚ÄúAt least, car drivers do go through some level of training before they are issued a driving license in India,‚Äù said Piyush Tewari, founder of SaveLIFE Foundation . ‚ÄúThis is a missing factor for many two-wheeler riders. There is almost negligible training that people undergo in terms of crash prevention, road safety rules... they just learn how to operate the bike. So that is a major overall contributor to crashes.‚Äù

The ministry data also revealed that about 72% of road accidents involved drivers holding a valid driver license. Of 317 victims of traumatic brain injury from road accidents studied for a 2018 AIIMS paper , only two-thirds were carrying a ‚Äúformal driving license‚Äù; only one had a learner‚Äôs license.

The driving license for two-wheelers is almost a joke, said Nakai.

‚ÄúI took a written test for my driving licence and then drove in a car for the road test,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúAfter finishing my drive, the person assessing me noticed I had applied for both two-wheelers and cars. When I said I would drop off the car and come back with a bike in a few minutes, he said, ‚ÄòSince you can drive a car, you would know how to ride a motorcycle.‚Äô That was how it was.‚Äù

Given the kind of motorcycles available in the market now, such oversight in granting licences is dangerous. ‚ÄúMost riders in India do not have sufficient training to handle motorcycles like a KTM-390 (a powerful and very fast motorcycle) or other such bikes,‚Äù added Nakai. ‚ÄúThe skills needed to handle and ride these bigger bikes are very different from riding a basic motorcycle. One needs to undergo special training to be able to ride them safely. But, in India, if you have a driving license, it is a blanket permit to ride anything from a scooty to a Hayabusa [superbike] and here everybody gets a two-wheeler license.‚Äù

In contrast, Singapore has multi-tiered license categories and minimum age requirements corresponding to the power of the bikes. A Grade 1 license for 100cc bikes is issued at 18 years of age, and only after more training and at the age of 19 years one can apply for a Grade 2 for 150-200cc two-wheelers and a Grade 3 license for superbikes is issued at the age of 20, said Tewari. ‚ÄúAt the moment, a 19-year-old in India could get a learner‚Äôs license and drive a superbike, which is almost like a weapon in the hands of untrained youngsters,‚Äù he said.

Road infrastructure and vehicle design

Suchi Vora, 34, an architect in Pune, has been riding two-wheelers since she was 16 even though she started learning how to ride one when she was a 13-year-old like many of her peers did at the time in her hometown. The roads on which she started riding in the 1990s have come a long way and are much improved today, she said.

‚ÄúThe city‚Äôs road and infrastructure have advanced tremendously from the time I first started riding but they have become more dangerous too,‚Äù said Vora. ‚ÄúThe city roads are a patchwork at best. They are uneven and riddled with potholes, which are practically deathtraps. There are more people speeding on our streets and the traffic has become a lot worse compared to the improvement in city roads. In the outskirts, the roads are still pretty bad. I do not feel safe taking my scooty to far away places‚Ä¶ I use a car. There is always someone coming from the wrong side or jumping signals. You never know what could hit you if you switch off even for a minute.‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo-wheelers are becoming more fuel efficient and hence their popularity is high in both rural and urban areas,‚Äù said Maitra of IIT. ‚ÄúThe road infrastructure is growing as well but it is not keeping pace with the growing number of vehicles and also the quality of the road infrastructure is not up to the mark.‚Äù

On national highways, on average, driving on the wrong side of the road caused 5.2% and drunken driving led to 3.7% of the accidents, according to the government report.

‚ÄúOur road infrastructure is not very forgiving, one violation could lead to an accident,‚Äù added Maitra. ‚ÄúThis is especially true in the case of two-wheeler drivers. Even though cars also violate rules, they are at least protected by the vehicle in some ways.‚Äù

While road and infrastructure development has been sluggish, two-wheelers have evolved at a much faster pace and the current vehicles available in India are far more efficient, powerful and speedier than the scooters that the majority used to ride in the 1990s, experts and bikers told IndiaSpend. ‚ÄúWhile the scooters and bikes of the 1990s used to struggle to accelerate, motorcycles available in India today have become a lot faster,‚Äù said Nakai. ‚ÄúTwo-wheeler development has far outpaced infrastructure development in our country.‚Äù

This is where road and vehicle design clash. The current speed limit in the country is 80 km/h on a four-lane highway. Even the entry-level 100cc motorcycles hit speeds of 80 km/h without much trouble.

Overspeeding caused, on average, 71.6% of all road accidents on national highways, the Central report said. If the speed limit on our roads is reduced to about 55 km/h -57 km/h, we could save around 30% to 37% lives, according to an advisor to the WHO, as IndiaSpend reported .

Helmets and trauma injury

Almost everyone in India who has ridden a bike or scooter has done so without a helmet at least once in their lives, noted Nakai. ‚ÄúA huge number of bikers do not wear a helmet and among those who wear one, a lot of the helmets are of poor quality,‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúAgain, this is because of our attitude towards safety. We do not take safety seriously.‚Äù Not wearing helmets resulted in deaths of 44,666 (30,148 drivers and 14,518 pillions) or 29.82% of total road accident fatalities during 2019, according to the ministry data .

Correct helmet use can lead to a 42% reduction in the risk of fatal injuries and a 69% reduction in the risk of head injuries according to the WHO . ‚ÄúOftentimes, we have seen that it [death] is because of either not wearing a helmet or wearing a very poor quality helmet,‚Äù said Tewari. ‚ÄúAnother challenge is implementing the helmet rule and availability of affordable and quality helmets right now.‚Äù

380,"Despite lockdown, no big drop in accidents, deaths on road during 2020 in Maharashtra","The coronavirus-induced lockdown shut down Maharashtra for the better part of 2020 but an analysis of the Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) data has found that while road accidents across the state dropped by a quarter from 2019, fatalities came down by just 10 per cent.

A total of 24,971 road accidents were reported in 2020 that left 11,569 people dead. Despite the lockdown restrictions on movement, accidents dropped 24 per cent, and fatalities remained high in comparison to 2019 when 32,925 crashes had led to 12,788 deaths.

Of the 10,773 fatal accidents, an average of over 1,000 accidents was reported in January and February alone. Between March and September, this number fell below a thousand. The lowest number of 282 fatal accidents was reported in April, causing 303 fatalities. The highest number of 1,368 accidents took place in December, in which 1,462 people were killed.

The reason behind this high number of accidents, a senior HSP official said, could be attributed to the high volume of vehicles on the road due to the discontinuance of the train services and speeding.

The massive numbers of people walking on the highways, trying to escape the Maharashtra lockdown and reach home in other dsitricts within Maharashtra or in other states, were also vulnerable to road accidents.

Across India, most of the horrific road accidents reported in 2020 were the ones that claimed the lives of migrant workers on their way back home on foot amid the lockdown, and Maharashtra was no exception. While the worst tragedy took place when a freight train mowed down 16 migrant workers walking on the tracks, four other labourers were crushed to death and three injured in the early days of the lockdown when a speeding truck ran over them at Bharol village in Virar on Mumbai-Ahmedabad Highway on March 28. The men were headed to their villages in Rajasthan on foot but had been turned back from the Maharashtra-Gujarat border. The truck hit them from behind.

According to the HSP road accident data for 2020 accessed by The Indian Express, of the total road accident fatalities in the state, 2,214 were pedestrians who died after being hit by vehicles ‚Äî the second-highest fatality after 5,868 two-wheeler riders who accounted for over half the total fatalities. Four-wheeler accidents, too, led to 1,576

fatalities.

A bulk of the fatalities (9,152 deaths or 79%) were caused by speeding. Another 3,160 deaths were reported in hit-and-run cases but the type of collision could not be ascertained in

these deaths.

The highest fatalities were reported from Pune rural (696 deaths in 1,230 accidents), Nashik rural (801 deaths in 1,239 accidents) and Ahmednagar (642 deaths in 1,225 accidents). At 1,812, Mumbai recorded the highest number of accidents in the state but fewer deaths at 349.

Dhawal Ashar of World Resources Institute (WRI), India, a non-profit group that works to prevent road accidents in Mumbai, said, ‚ÄúIt is a worrying trend in Pune rural if over one out of every two crashes are fatal, unlike Mumbai where it could be possibly ascribed to many factors, including the high vehicle density.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn Mumbai, the speed of vehicles is less as compared to highways and so the severity of accidents and injuries are more on highways. Further, in Mumbai trauma care is easily accessible but on highways, this is a major concern,‚Äù said Rajeev Choubey, risk management specialist of Resilient India, a non-profit group helping the state government to reduce accidents.","A total of 24,971 road accidents were reported in 2020 that left 11,569 people dead.

India continued to have the most road fatalities in the world, followed by China, a distant second at 63,093 deaths in 2,12,846 road accidents in 2019, the report revealed. The United States of America (USA) reported the most road accidents at 2,211,439, and witnessed 37,461 deaths in 2019.

According to the report, speeding was the leading cause of deaths, while, in terms of vehicles, two-wheelers were involved in most road fatalities.

Across states, most road accidents were reported in Tamil Nadu (57,228), followed by Madhya Pradesh (50,669), Uttar Pradesh (42,572), Kerala (41,111) and Karnataka (40,658) accidents.

Maharashtra ranked sixth with 32,295 accidents, but saw the second-highest number of fatalities (12,788), after 22,655 in Uttar Pradesh.

Among cities, Delhi retained its first rank with 1,463 deaths, followed by Jaipur (1,283), Chennai (1,252) and Bengaluru (768).

Mumbai ranked ninth with 447 people being killed in road accidents in 2019.

The report stated that national and state highways, which account for just five per cent of the total roads in the country, saw the most deaths ‚Äî 61% of the total.

Two-wheelers were involved in 37% of the road deaths in the country, followed by pedestrians at 17% and light vehicles (comprising cars, jeeps and taxis) at 16%. A total of 56,136 people riding two-wheelers lost their lives, while 25,858 pedestrians died in 2019, stated the report.

The report stated that speeding accounted for most road accidents and deaths (ranging between 63% and 73% for accidents and between 62% and 70% for deaths) on all categories of national highways.

In 2019, like in previous years, young adults in the age group of 18-45 years accounted for nearly 69.3% of road accident deaths, while those in the age group of 18 ‚Äì 60 accounted for 84.3%.

Interestingly, it wasn‚Äôt curved roads that took the most lives ‚Äî 96,624 people lost their lives on straight roads, while curved roads saw 20,141 deaths.

‚ÄúTraditionally, for any accident or crash, the major causes could be ‚Äòdriver/human‚Äô, ‚Äòroad infrastructure‚Äô or ‚Äòvehicle-related factors‚Äô. Sometimes, there might be combinations of these factors which might lead to accidents. Among these major factors, ‚Äòdriver/human‚Äô-related factors or errors dominate,‚Äù said Nagendra R Velaga, associate professor (transportation systems engineering), department of civil engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay. Examples of such human/driver factors include ‚Äî rash driving, fatigue/sleep deprivation (particularly for long-haul truck drivers), speeding (due to certain reasons like time pressure or time constraints to reach the destination), on-board distractions (eg: using digital devices such as mobile phones while driving), driving under influence of alcohol and drugs, among other, said Velaga.

‚ÄúAdvanced technologies and artificial intelligence can control some human errors or driver factors (for example, camera-based speed-detection system). However, I strongly feel that it is the individual‚Äôs responsibility to respect their own life use required and appropriate precautionary measures (use seatbelt and helmet, follow traffic rules, and do not use phone while driving, avoid rash driving and drunk driving),‚Äù added Velaga

Former chairman of the Supreme Court (SC) committee on road safety, retired justice KS Radhakrishnan, said speeding is the major cause of accidents, especially on straight roads and highways, where control on speed is minimal. On curved roads, speeding is less, due to which accidents are less. ‚ÄúCondition of roads, traffic violations, drink and drive, among others, are also major contributors to high number of fatalities and accidents,‚Äù said Radhakrishnan.

Radhakrishnan, whose committee conducted 250 meetings with the government, national highways authority, state traffic departments and international agencies, to curb accidents, said, ‚ÄúThe meetings are heading in the right direction,‚Äù said Radhakrishnan. ‚ÄúThe fine in India is not a deterrent,‚Äù said Radhakrishnan adding, ‚ÄúHowever, the average person here will not be able to afford heavy fines. The government will just end up seizing licences.‚Äù

To bring down fatalities, Velaga said, ‚ÄúIn addition to national-level policies and legislation, regional or local-level control strategies or measures are required. Strong enforcement is also required.‚Äù

Velaga also said, ‚ÄúCausal and impact analysis of accidents/crashes is required for state, regional and local level. More focus on research related to human/driver factors may be needed to understand the exact of factors influencing the crashes and suitable remedial measures.‚Äù

Commenting on the report, Piyush Tewari, CEO and founder, SaveLIFE Foundation said, ‚ÄúThere is an urgent need for full implementation of the road safety provisions in the motor vehicle (amendment) Act 2019, including implementation of child safety provisions. Additionally, identifying risk factors specific to the safety of children and creating a plan to mitigate them should be prioritised by all state governments.‚Äù","India continued to have the most road fatalities in the world, followed by China, a distant second at 63,093 deaths in 2,12,846 road accidents in 2019, the report revealed.

386,Road accidents in India are like silent pandemic: Rajnath Singh,"Voicing his concerns over rising road accidents, Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said India accounts for nearly 11 per cent of the total road accidents in the world and it is no less than a silent pandemic.

Addressing the 'Karmayogis' of Border Road Organisation (BRO) via video conferencing, the Union Defence Minister said, ""Accidents on the roads are a cause of great concern for us today. It is a matter of great surprise that our country has less than 3 per cent of the world's total vehicles, but accidents are close to 11 per cent. Every year around 4.5-5 lakh accidents and 1.5 lakh unfortunate deaths occur in the country. It is not less than a silent pandemic.""

""To get rid of all this, whatever steps the government has taken, such as approving the 'National Road Safety Policy', bringing in the 'Motor Vehicle Act 2020', identifying black spots on national highways...these centres also have their own importance,"" he said.

BRO on Friday launched four new software for works management, road infrastructure digitisation, human resource management and recruitment management.

""The four software being launched today will bring efficiency to the work of the organization and will also save their time. Their creation also marks the success of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' and 'Digital India' campaigns,"" stated Singh.

The Union Defence Minister said the start of two 'Centres of Excellence' based on the study of 'Road Safety', and roads, bridges, tunnels, air-fields is a matter of great pride for the country. He said these centres complement each other in their objectives.

""Right from its inception, BRO has been playing a vital role in the progress of the nation by building roads, tunnels and other infrastructure in remote areas. The most important component is connectivity. For connectivity, our BRO personnel have been working tirelessly even in the midst of difficulties like severe winter, heat, rain, snowfall. In the last 5-7 years, BRO has made even more remarkable achievements,"" he said.

He emphasised the increase in the budget of BRO by three to four times during the last five to seven years is not a trivial matter. Apart from this, 3,270 sets of special high altitude clothing are approved for our engineers and other personnel.

The Union Defence Minister further mentioned the slogans like ""Sawdhani hati durghatna ghati"" also helps making people aware while on road.

Singh further extended his best wishes to woman biker Kanchan for her solo expedition.

""I feel good knowing about Kanchan ji who is going to start solo women motorcycle expedition today. I was told that at an early age she started riding a motorcycle. So far she has covered 21,000 km in 10 years. I wish her all the best for this expedition,"" he said.

388,"Experts point at flaws, NHAI says measures in place","Gurgaon: All ‚Äúspeed calming measures‚Äù and norms laid down by the Indian Road Congress (IRC) are in place on the U-turn flyover at IFFCO Chowk, the National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) officials said, even as road safety experts alleged that flyovers across NCR were planned keeping cars and not two-wheelers in mind. The safety of these structures have come under the spotlight on Sunday after two bikers died allegedly after they lost balance and toppled over the railing of the flyover 20 feet below.‚ÄúThis kind of incident has not happened (on the flyover) before and most likely occurred due to over speeding on the part of the commuter. From our end, all safety measures have been taken from the very first day. All speed calming measures are in place. We have also put signage alerting people to the speed limit of 40 kilometres per hour and have installed four rows of cat's eye where the curvature of the flyover begins so that the speed of a vehicle gets reduced automatically,‚Äù an NHAI official, who did not want to be identified, told TOI.Speed breakers, as per the NHAI, cannot be put on these elevated roads because there was a chance of vehicles jumping on these as well. Used by commuters travelling from MG Road and Huda City Centre towards Delhi and Sukhrali, the four-lane unidirectional flyover was constructed and opened to commuters in 2018.‚ÄúChevron boards that warn drivers of the curve ahead, and other relevant signage have been also installed at the curvature. The height of the boundary wall is also as per the IRC standards. Multiple safety audits of the structure have not shown any discrepancies,‚Äù the official added.Road safety experts with whom TOI spoke, however, said that such accidents were increasing not just in Gurgaon but across the NCR and the rest of the country. Multiple factors, they say, are responsible for this.‚ÄúOne of the issues is that these structures are normally designed for cars without taking two-wheelers into consideration. The U-turns and ramps on the interchanges are, however, also used by two-wheelers, which tend to then move at the same speed as a car but may not be necessarily safe for them. In addition, side crash protections are not taken into consideration, as a result of which commuters topple over because sufficient protection has not been given on the side of the structure and the sidewall has not been correctly designed,‚Äù Sewa Ram, associate professor and urban roads design expert at the School of Planning and Architecture, said.Ram recommended the usage of ‚Äúlow-height speed-calming measures‚Äù and designing ‚Äúforgiving roads‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhat forgiving roads do is that if there are three lanes, the outer lane, closest to the boundary wall, is painted in such a way as to alert the commuters not to drive on it. So, if by mistake a person‚Äôs vehicle starts skidding, the outer lane serves as a buffer, ensuring they will skid onto the lane but not fall down. The logic of forgiving measures is that if a person does make a mistake, they do not pay with their life,‚Äù Ram said.Rohit Baluja, director of the Institute of Road Traffic Education, meanwhile, attributed such mishaps to the absence of traffic engineering within the traffic management system and emphasised the need to follow the principles of a ‚Äúsafe systems approach‚Äù, which anticipates mistakes of commuters and implies taking measures to ensure that people do not die or sustain serious injuries.","Gurgaon: All ‚Äúspeed calming measures‚Äù and norms laid down by the Indian Road Congress (IRC) are in place on the U-turn flyover at IFFCO Chowk, the National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) officials said, even as road safety experts alleged that flyovers across NCR were planned keeping cars and not two-wheelers in mind.

389,India saw 13% decline in fatal road accidents in 2020: Nitin Gadkari informs Parliament,"Representational image

Around 3,66,138 road accidents took place in India in 2020, causing 1,31,714 deaths. The figure was around 13 percent lower than the corresponding number for 2019, which saw 1,51,113 deaths due to road accidents in India, Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari said in a written response in Lok Sabha on August 5.

One must note here, one of the reasons behind the sharp decrease in the number of road accidents in 2020 was partially due to the coronavirus pandemic outbreak, which forced the entire nation into months of strict lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. During this time, the movement of vehicles -- commercial and private -- was highly regulated.

Giving further details on road accidents in India, the Road Transport Minister informed the Lok Sabha that Tamil Nadu recorded the highest number of road accidents followed by West Bengal and Karnataka.

He added that road accidents in India occur mainly due to speeding, drunken driving, driving on the wrong side, lane indiscipline, use of mobile phones while driving, mechanical defect, faulty vehicle, bad roads, bad weather, and lack of knowledge on road signage.

Gadkari pointed out that now road safety has been made an integral part of road design at the planning stage.

""The ministry has delegated powers to regional officers of MoRTH for technical approval of the detailed estimates for rectification of identified road accident black spots,"" he said.

While addressing the issue, Gadkari also said that his ministry has devised a multi-pronged strategy to address the road safety issues. The strategy will focus on education, road engineering, vehicle engineering, enforcement, and emergency care.

To minimise the number of road accidents, the Government of India has also imposed stricter punitive measures for violations of traffic rules under the new amended Motor Vehicles Act.","Representational imageAround 3,66,138 road accidents took place in India in 2020, causing 1,31,714 deaths.

390,Sound of Indian musical instruments to be used for horns of vehicles: Nitin Gadkari,"Nitin Gadkari said he was considering to replace the sirens of ambulances and police vehicles by a more pleasant tune played on the All India Radio. (File photo)

Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said he was planning to bring a law under which the horns of vehicles would be replaced by the sound of Indian musical instruments.

Speaking at an event in Nashik on Monday, Nitin Gadkari said he was considering replacing the sirens of ambulances and police vehicles with a more pleasant tune played on the All India Radio.

‚ÄúNow I want to put an end to these sirens as well. Now I am studying the sirens (used by) ambulances and police,"" PTI quoted Gadkari as saying.

‚ÄúAn artist composed a tune of Akashwani (All Indian Radio) and it was played early in the morning. I am thinking of using that tune for ambulances so that people feel pleasant. It is so irritating, especially after ministers pass by, the sirens are used at full volume. This also harms the ears,"" he added.

Sounds of flute, tabla, violin, mouth organ, harmonium, etc could be used as horn, Nitin Gadkari said.

We lose 3% of our GDP due to accidents: Gadkari

Nitin Gadkari said five lakh accidents take place in India every year, which claim the lives of 1.5 lakh people and lakhs are injured.

""We lose 3 per cent of our GDP due to accidents,"" he said.

However, there has been a downfall in these numbers, the minister said. Accidents on the Mumbai-Pune highway have come down by 50 per cent. Tamil Nadu government has brought down accidents and deaths by 50 per cent.

393,IIT Madras Researchers developing Data-Driven Strategies to enhance Road Safety in Tamil Nadu,"CHENNAI : Indian Institute of Technology Madras Researchers are developing data-driven strategies to enhance road Safety in Tamil Nadu. Towards this, a one-day workshop on developing an action plan was organized today (12) by Center of Excellence for Human Factors and Safety Science @ RBG Labs, IIT Madras, in coordination with the National Health Mission.

Various stakeholders involved in road safety include the Police, Health, Transport, Road owning agencies, Education, Rural Development, and Local Self Government, among others, participated in the workshop held at IIT Madras Research Park.

The outcomes of this workshop will be used to help a focused action plan and be used as a policy advisory to help reduce road accidents and fatalities in Tamil Nadu.

Conveying his message for the workshop, Thiru Ma. Subramanian, Minister for Health, Medical Education and Family Welfare, Government of Tamil Nadu, said, ‚ÄúThis workshop is the first of many such design-thinking based strategizing workshops for road safety. This coordinated knowledge sharing session among all the road safety stakeholders in Tamil Nadu will be a pathway to continuously evolve successful road safety policies in the State.‚Äù

The key outcomes envisaged from this program include:

√ò Clear long term policies and strategies for moving towards an ‚Äòaccident-free Tamil Nadu‚Äô

√ò Short term strategies to improve road safety and minimize road traffic accidents during the next 3 months (November 2021 to January 2022)

√ò Action Points and Key Performance Indicators for each of the Stakeholder Departments, including Health, Police, Road owning agencies, Transport, Education and Local Bodies.

√ò Modalities for sharing and utilizing the data available with Stakeholder departments for collective action in ensuring road safety. For example, Grid Analysis data available with Health Departments shall be used for enforcement, preventive action awareness creation, among others, by the stakeholder departments concerned.

Elaborating on this engagement, Prof. Venkatesh Balasubramanian, Faculty In-Charge, Center of Excellence for Human Factors and Safety Science @ RBG Labs, IIT Madras, who is coordinating this workshop, said, ‚ÄúAvoiding accidents and fatalities in accidents is an essential requirement to be a developed nation. Roads are shared assets and the safety on them is a collective responsibility of all the stakeholders.‚Äù

Further, Prof. Venkatesh Balasubramanian said, ‚ÄúWe have been advocating a data-driven systems approach to road safety through our Transportation Safety Framework (TSF) to have a holistic improvement. While TN has been performing well on reducing the fatalities from road accidents, in 2021, after the lockdown there has been a steady increase in fatality. Therefore, it is quintessential to develop a good strategy based on data to address this on a priority basis. It is, therefore, necessary to have a design thinking approach to solve the problem by not just identifying the issues but implementing changes that are sustainable in the local conditions.‚Äù

In 2020, Tamil Nadu became the first State in India and globally, the only administered territory to have achieved a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target of reducing deaths due to road accidents by 50 per cent. However, there has been a steady increase in the number of road fatalities in 2021.

Speaking on the occasion, Prof. Ravindra Gettu, Dean (Industrial Consultancy and Sponsored Research), IIT Madras, said, ‚ÄúThe Action plan that has been drawn up is expected to make a significant impact on fatalities and road safety in general, especially due to the involvement of all stakeholders concerned through this design thinking approach.‚Äù

To curb the seasonal peak traffic crashes in the fourth quarter of 2021, a strategic team of TN stakeholders involved in road safety were identified to prepare a strategic short-term and long-term action plan for improving road safety in the State.

394,Rs 600-cr Bus Rapid Transit System corridor awaits repair in Amritsar,"Charanjit Singh Teja

Tribune News Service

Amritsar, October 16

The design of the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS), stated to be a faulty one, has been triggering accidents amid infrastructural shortcomings on a regular basis. On September 18, a youth lost his life when he was allegedly run over by a BRTS bus near the Golden Gate area.

The authorities appear to have failed to conduct maintenance and install reflectors to avoid accidents.

Started in 2016, the multi-crore BRTS project has been lacking maintenance and remained neglected. The project is worth Rs 600 crore, but the lanes don‚Äôt appear to justify the colossal amount invested in construction as they are in pathetic condition at many points, say residents, adding that poor planning and usage of substandard material has done most of the damage to its infrastructure.

The grills installed alongside the corridors are also missing from several locations. For officials, drug addicts are the usual suspects. Some broken grills, too, are lying on the road leading to accidents. The reflectors and other traffic infrastructure are also missing.

Most of the accidents happen when commuters on the main road fail to recognise the starting point of the corridor.

In 2019, a committee constituted by the state government had identified nine black spots on the 31-km-long BRTS corridor.After the study, traffic experts had written to the Public Works Department to take appropriate action to prevent accidents, but the latter is yet to act.

Black spots had been identified at Bhandari Bridge, BRTS station outside the railway station, Valmiki Chowk, Putligarh Chowk, Civil Hospital, Ramtalai Chowk, Husainpura Chowk, Mall Mandi Chowk and Alpha Mall.

Experts claimed that lack of proper signage, reflectors and other safety infrastructure led to accidents on the BRTS corridor.

Gopala Dhawan, a traffic expert, who studied the accident patterns in the BRTS lanes, said the authorities should install reflectors and signage of no entry of other vehicles and a dedicated bus lane on every entry point. ‚ÄúSuch signage is missing on the route. Secondly, the authorities have to educate the commuters and city residents about the rules and risks,‚Äù he added.","Charanjit Singh TejaTribune News ServiceAmritsar, October 16The design of the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS), stated to be a faulty one, has been triggering accidents amid infrastructural shortcomings on a regular basis.

395,Sleep testing can reduce sleep disorder related road accidents in India,"India is one of the countries with an alarmingly high number of deaths attributed to road accidents. Not only casualties but a huge number of people get injured seriously every year due to road accidents and many of these people become handicapped every year. In the last decade, road accidents caused death for 13 lakh people, and another 50 lakh people got injured in the country, as revealed by a study by World Bank.

In terms of vehicular pollution, India has only 1% of total vehicles in the world, while the country accounts for 11% of the global death due to road accidents, which is the highest in the world. India accounts for around 4.5 lakh road accidents every year, which claims around 1.5 lakh lives. This means every hour, the country witnesses around 53 road accidents killing one person every 4 minutes.

Many of these accidents happen on the highways and expressways, involving large commercial vehicles. While there are several reasons behind these accidents, one of them is lack of sleep. A study conducted in 2020 by SaveLIFE Foundation and Mahindra revealed that truck drivers in India drive 12 hours a day covering around 417 km, with almost 50% of them admitting that they feel sleepy or tired while driving. Many of these truck drivers or bus drivers who drive vehicles on highways suffer from Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), a disorder that majorly goes undetected because of lack of testing.

OSA could actually create very risky situations when it comes to road safety. According to Sibasish Dey, Head, Medical Affairs, Asia and Latin America, ResMed, sleep apnea increases the risk of road accidents by 300% and is the cause behind many major road accidents in India. According to a study by Lancet, in India, there are around 28 million people who suffer from sleep apnea, and clearly, that leads to many drowsy drivers on Indian roads. The drivers with OSA are around 2.6 times prone to road accidents than general drivers.

The untreated sleep disorders, excessive pressure on drivers can result in a reduced level of alertness on roads. As AIIMS Neurology India‚Äôs research has found, more than 20% of all road accident victims are found suffering from sleep disorders and OSA. Another study revealed that more than 23% of truck drivers have sleep deprivation. Clearly, these drowsy drivers can cause fatal accidents on roads.

Economic impact:

Back in 2016, the deaths and serious injuries caused by road crashes cost around 7.5% of India's GDP or ‚Çπ12.9 lakh crore, revealed the World Bank study. The amount is more than double the figure cited by the Indian government at 3% of GDP or ‚Çπ4.3 lakh crore. According to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) findings, the socio-economic costs of road crashes in India is at ‚Çπ147,114 crore, which is equivalent to 0.77% of the country's GDP.

The injuries and deaths due to the road accidents impose a severe financial burden and push the respective victims‚Äô households into poverty and the already poor into debt. Road crashes also impact heavily on the country‚Äôs human assets. Around 76.2% of people who are killed in road crashes in India are in their prime working-age, 18-45 years. This means the country loses a massive number of its workforce every year, just because of road accidents.

What‚Äôs the solution?

Sleep disorder and its effect on road safety is something that gets very little attention in India. The lack of awareness among the policymakers, drivers, OEMs, and other stakeholders should be a concern.

Several countries around the world conduct regular tests of drivers for sleep deprivation in an attempt to ensure safety on roads. Australia tests commercial vehicle drivers once every three years for drivers aged up to 49, and yearly for drivers aged 50 or more than that. In the EU countries as well drivers must seek a diagnosis in case of sleep apnea, and can only return to driving once the condition is under control.

As the Indian government has been taking several measures in order to enhance road safety, there should be an attempt to educate the drivers about the importance of sleep. While the policymakers need to take initiatives, the automobile OEMs too have equal responsibilities. The auto manufacturers can start awareness campaigns to educate vehicle buyers and drivers about sleep deprivation and its impact on road safety.","India is one of the countries with an alarmingly high number of deaths attributed to road accidents.

396,Data: 26 States/UTs report 18% less Road Accidents & 15% less Deaths in Lockdown year 2020,"Road Accidents have been the leading cause of death among young adult males in India. India is also the country with most road accident deaths among 199 different countries. Though the number of road accidents has reduced by around 10% in the last 10 years, the number of deaths has increased. In the lockdown year of 2020, 26 States/UTs that have reported complete data, saw 18% less Road Accidents & 15% less Deaths.

India is among the countries that reports the greatest number of road accidents in the world. Every year, thousands of road accidents are reported across India resulting in fatalities and severe injuries. Road injuries are the leading cause of death among young adult males in India. According to the WHO, in 2019, road injury was among the top 10 causes of deaths globally. More people lost their lives to road injuries than to tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, or liver cirrhosis. Road accidents are a socio-economic burden on the victims‚Äô households as well as on the economy. Unlike certain chronic illnesses and diseases, road injuries are preventable through effective interventions and stringent enforcement of rules, as most of them occur due to negligence, poor infrastructure, and carelessness.

An average of 1200+ road accidents were reported daily in India in 2019

Responding to a question in the parliament recently, the Union Government stated that the total number of road accidents in the country stood at 4,49,002 during 2019. Compared to 2018, the number has dropped by nearly 4%. The trend in the number of reported road accidents from 2010 as per the annual ‚ÄòRoad Accidents in India‚Äô report reveals that the least number of accidents were reported in 2019. In 2010, 5.28 lakh road accidents had taken place, and since then there has been a gradual decrease in the number of such accidents. Between 2010 & 2019, there has been a 10% reduction in the number of road accidents. The data is based on information supplied by the Police Departments of States and UTs. Hence, the actual number of accidents may be higher.

According to data presented in the Lok Sabha earlier this year, 26 states/UTs had submitted data for the entire calendar year 2020. The data indicated that the total number of accidents in these 26 states/UTs had dropped by around 48,500 in 2020, a reduction of more than 18% compared to 2019. The nationwide lockdown and movement restrictions imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19 may have also contributed to the reduction.

Fatality due to road accidents is highest in India

India ranks first in the number of road accident deaths among 199 countries and accounts for almost 11% of the accident-related deaths in the world, according to the Road Accidents in India 2019 report 2019. Though the number of accidents has reduced in the last 10 years, the number of fatalities has gone up. In 2019, 1.51 lakh persons lost their lives due to road accidents, which is merely 0.2% less than 2018. The fatalities number was about 1.35 lakhs in 2010 and has increased by around 12% between 2010 & 2019.

In 2020, the 26 states/UTs reported a decline in the number of deaths due to road accidents by more than 13,000 or 15%. Over 79,000 deaths were reported in 2020 in these 26 states compared to more than 93,000 deaths in 2019. As noted earlier, this could be because of the nationwide lockdown that restricted the movement of people & vehicles.

However, the possibility of under-reporting in fatalities cannot be ruled out. The data reported by police does not include the deaths that take place in hospitals after 30 days if the hospital data and police data are not linked. Further, fatalities in which the person who caused the accident cannot be identified will not be reported since crime/offence under IPC must be lodged against an individual and not against the road or vehicle or any object.

In 2019, around 4.51 lakh persons were injured in road accidents, the lowest since 2010. The number of persons injured in road accidents has dropped by almost 15% between 2010 & 2019.

90% of Road Accidents were reported by 15 states

A total of 15 states together account for more than 90% of the accidents since 2015. In the last five years, Tamil Nadu topped the list with an average of more than 65,000 accidents reported each year. The state reported more than 70,000 accidents in 2016 which has dropped to over 57,000 in 2019. Tamil Nadu reported close to 45,500 accidents in 2020, the lowest since 2015, yet the highest in India. The majority of the accidents in the state took place on the state and national highways. Tamil Nadu also had the highest number of black spots in the country, which is defined as a 500-meter stretch on the national highways where 5 road accidents or 10 fatalities took place in the last three years. Though Tamil Nadu reported the most accidents, Uttar Pradesh reported the greatest number of fatalities.

Since 2015, among the top 15 states, the states of Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and West Bengal have reported a drop in the number of accidents whereas the states of Bihar, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, and Kerala have reported an increase in the number of road accidents. Seven of these states- Telangana, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, and Gujarat which have reported data for January to December 2020, have reported a drop in accidents even in 2020.

2 out of 3 fatalities in road accidents were due to overspeeding

Over speeding was the reason behind more than 70% of the accidents and 67% of the fatalities, in 2019. Other contributors to the high incidence of road accidents in the country are drunken driving, driving on the wrong side or lane indiscipline, jumping red lights, and usage of phones which are due to poor enforcement of traffic rules.

India ranks 3 globally in terms of total accidents

According to World Road Statistics- 2018 of the International Road Federation, India ranks 3rd in terms of total accidents, among 199 countries. The USA tops the list with more than 31 Lakh accidents. In terms of the incidence of accidents per lakh population, India‚Äôs incidence is 36 per lakh people which is much less than many developed and developing countries like the USA (684), Japan (393), Iran (365) and Turkey (233). However, in terms of fatalities, India tops the list.

Road crash had a severe impact on the vulnerable- poorer households, rural households, and women

A study titled ‚ÄòTraffic Crash Injuries and Disabilities: The Burden on Indian Society‚Äô was conducted by the World Bank to assess the socio-economic impact of road crashes in India across 4 states ‚Äî Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra which accounted for most road accident deaths in the country. It surveyed accident cases and corresponding families of victims to understand the relation between road crash fatalities and poverty, inequality, and vulnerable road users in India. The key findings of the study are as follows-

Fatalities from road crashes are higher among poor families: The risk of a victim undergoing disability after a crash was also 2 times more likely among poor rural households.

The burden of the road crashed is disproportionately borne by poor households: More than 75% of poor households reported a decline in their income because of a road accident, as compared to 54% among high-income households. About 42% of the poor household respondents reported that their household went into debt because of borrowing money after a crash as compared to 11% of respondents from richer households.

Sharp rural-urban divide: The severe impact of the decline in income was highest among poor households in rural areas (56%) compared to those in urban areas (29.5%).

Women have been highly impacted: Women in the families of victims, irrespective of income, often had to take up extra work, assume greater responsibilities, and perform caregiving activities. 50% of women said they were severely affected by the decline in their household income after an accident. While around 11% reported taking up extra work to deal with the financial crisis, 40% of women reported a change in their working patterns post-crash.

Inequality in Insurance coverage and compensation : Insurance coverage was significantly higher among high-income households and households in urban areas as compared to lower-income households in urban areas. About 24% of respondents from high-income households said that they received compensation while, among poorer respondents, only 14% received compensation from insurance companies.

: Insurance coverage was significantly higher among high-income households and households in urban areas as compared to lower-income households in urban areas. About 24% of respondents from high-income households said that they received compensation while, among poorer respondents, only 14% received compensation from insurance companies. Other issues: In addition to financial distress, poor households also experienced a deterioration in their quality of life accompanied by psychological suffering and emotional distress.

Policy-based approaches have been recommended to save lives

The report suggests policy-oriented approaches for saving lives and improving the ability of victims and their families to get back on their feet. Some of the approaches suggested are the following

Inclusion of provision for immediate financial, medical, and legal aid.

Strengthening of health infrastructure and coverage to be made accessible and inclusive.

Post-crash support needs to be strengthened with governments providing a social security net for crash victims from low-income households.

Insurance coverage, especially for poor households must be expanded. An accessible legal framework for availing insurance and compensation for road crash victims should be created.

397,"Road accidents, deaths drop by over 20% in 2020 partly due to Covid-19: Gadkari","India has recorded a significant drop in road crashes and deaths in the first three quarters of calendar 2020 against same time in 2019. This is partly due to COVID-19 pandemic-prompted lockdowns and people voluntarily not venturing out to prevent transmission.

""India has seen a 26.48 per cent reduction in road accidents and a 22 per cent drop in deaths in 2020 against 2019‚Ä¶. COVID-19 has contributed to this reduction in accidents and deaths,"" Nitin Gadkari, Minister for Road Transport and Highways, said in a road safety conference.

Road Ministry sources later said the data refers to January to September 2020 against same-period 2019.

India, which loses almost 1.5 lakh lives every year on account of road accidents, is revising its target to drop the extent of road fatalities by half by 2025 or earlier, instead of the earlier target of 2030, said Gadkari. He cited Tamil Nadu's example recording a continuous drop in road accidents and deaths in the last three-four years.

""It's okay to miss road construction target, but we should try and meet the target of saving lives from road accidents and deaths earlier‚Ä¶,"" said Gadkari, pointing out that targeting reduction by half means seeing 75,000 deaths every year till 2030.

Reasons for drop

Other contributors to a drop in road crashes include India strengthening road safety measures like increasing penalties for traffic accidents; fixing and redesigning 'blackspots' or spaces identified with large accidents where road design could be changed; bringing in vehicle-safety parameters among others.

States like Tamil Nadu and some highway developers have lowered deaths and accidents through focused interventions like CCTVs surveillance, electronic-challans, and making road safety.

Tamil Nadu has seen fatalities from road accidents drop to 7,278 (for 11 months up to November) in 2020, against 17,218 deaths in 2016; road accidents have dropped to 40,725 (in 11 months of 2020) against 71,431 in 2016; and grievous injuries were down to 3,205 (11 months, 2020) against 82,163 in 2016.

According to Maj Gen (Retd) Pawan Anand, Secretary-General, Highway Operators' Association of India (HOAI), a body of highway operators and maintainers, the road developers have taken specific interventions like smoothening the sharper curves on highways and seen a significant drop in crashes. More lighting on several highways also resulted in a decline in accidents, said Anand. One of the national highway stretches -- Dharmavaram-Rajahmundri -- saw a 48 per cent drop in deaths and 20 per cent drop in crashes in three years of 2015-2018.

In another move, Uber, along with Lenskart, will provide free or subsidised spectacles to drivers, it was announced.

All-round awareness

Rajnath Singh, Defence Minister, called for all-round awareness to lower accidents, adding that he had asked his driver to speed up that resulted in an accident. Singh said that the Covid-19 pandemic has led to over 1.5 lakh deaths in about 11 months; road accidents result in as many deaths every year, indicating the scale of the challenge.","""India has seen a 26.48 per cent reduction in road accidents and a 22 per cent drop in deaths in 2020 against 2019‚Ä¶.

400,Covid-19: Is it safe to fly? Out-of-practice airline pilots are making mid-air errors,"Dangerously rusty

Back in the cockpit after time off recovering from Covid-19 , an airline pilot forgot to start his plane‚Äôs second engine for takeoff, a mistake that could have ended in disaster if he hadn‚Äôt aborted the flight.Another pilot, fresh from a seven-month layoff because of the pandemic and descending to land early in the morning, realized almost too late he hadn‚Äôt lowered the wheels and pulled out of the approach just 800 feet (240 meters) from the tarmac.Weeks earlier, a passenger plane leaving a busy airport headed off in the wrong direction, flown by a captain who was back on deck for the first time in more than six months.These potentially disastrous errors all took place in the US in recent months as pilots returned to work. In every case, crew blamed their oversight on a shortage of flying during Covid, the most deadly pandemic since the 1918 influenza outbreak and certainly the only one to have wreaked such havoc on what was a burgeoning global aviation industry.The incidents are among dozens of mistakes, confidentially declared by out-of-practice pilots since the start of the pandemic, that are stored on a low-profile database designed to identify emerging safety threats. The monitoring program, funded by the Federal Aviation Administration, is decades old but is now flashing warning signs as planes return to the skies across the world.Deep cuts by airlines left some 100,000 pilots globally working skeleton hours or on long-term leave, according to consulting firm Oliver Wyman. Many haven‚Äôt flown for more than 18 months. But as rising vaccination rates allow travel to resume, concerns are growing that a lack of proficiency, confidence, or simply one moment of forgetfulness could lead to tragedy.‚ÄúIt is really a critical situation,‚Äù said Uwe Harter, a grounded Airbus SE A380 pilot for Deutsche Lufthansa AG who‚Äôs also the executive vice president for technical and safety standards at the International Federation of Air Line Pilots‚Äô Associations. ‚ÄúThe last thing the industry needs now is a bad accident.‚ÄùWhile some airlines are providing pilots with adequate retraining, others are offering ‚Äúthe bare minimum,‚Äù if anything at all, said Harter, who himself hasn‚Äôt flown since February 2020. ‚ÄúThe regulations that we have aren‚Äôt sufficient.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs not as if authorities are blind to this. The International Civil Aviation Organization, which sets industry standards, and the International Air Transport Association have seen the risks looming for months. Both bodies, as well as Europe‚Äôs top aviation regulator, have published detailed training guides to help airlines transition out-of-practice pilots back into the air.But interviews with pilots from Asia and Europe ‚Äî and the database of anonymous accounts in the US ‚Äî reveal varying degrees of ability and confidence among those who have returned to duty, including pilots who have completed retraining programs.That‚Äôs partly because no amount of classroom or virtual theory, or practice in a flight simulator, can replicate the real-life pressures of a cockpit. Nor do these preparations fully take into account the psychological, emotional and financial stresses from the pandemic weighing on airline crew.Aviation has largely been defined by its colossal financial losses ‚Äî $138 billion last year alone and another $52 billion expected in 2021 ‚Äî since Covid brought travel to a standstill. As the industry tries to claw back some of its lost revenue, managing the safety risks posed by returning pilots is an additional burden and one that airlines with stronger balance sheets have the luxury of handling more proficiently than others.The scale of the problem is partly documented on the US Aviation Safety Reporting System, the database of safety incidents voluntarily reported by pilots, crew and air-traffic controllers.The pilot who tried to get airborne on one engine in December last year said in his report that his recovery from a Covid infection was ‚Äúheavy on my mind‚Äù and contributed to his ‚Äúlack of focus.‚Äù The ASRS reports don‚Äôt name the crew, airlines or airports involved.Flight Safety Foundation, a Virginia-based not-for-profit group that advises the aviation industry, said it‚Äôs aware of the incidents on the ASRS database and is monitoring the situation globally. ‚ÄúThe more we know about potential safety issues, the better we are able to mitigate the risk,‚Äù Flight Safety Foundation President and Chief Executive Officer Hassan Shahidi said.In a line of work where there‚Äôs little room for professional error, the dangers become stark. While most of the mistakes are minor ‚Äî they include flying momentarily at the incorrect altitude or speed, or taxiing across a runway in the wrong place ‚Äî some of the worst aviation disasters are rooted in seemingly inconsequential missteps.And worryingly, the number of incidents tied to a lack of pilot proficiency climbed almost immediately after the pandemic began to disrupt commercial flying schedules, according to a February study by the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona.Rajee Olaganathan, an assistant professor at the university, found one such ASRS report in the eight months before March 2020, then 10 in the next eight months. All of them referred to problems landing the aircraft. In one, a pilot described approaching the runway with too much altitude. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt at the comfort level I would have liked,‚Äù he wrote.Olaganathan said her findings show airlines need to educate pilots about skill deterioration and build suitably tailored training programs. But crew also need to be candid about their abilities. ‚ÄúPilots need to make an honest assessment of their skills and confidence upon returning to work,‚Äù she said in an interview.The obvious dangers posed by poor pilots, even before Covid, have made the job one of the most strictly controlled on the planet. United Nations agency ICAO usually requires pilots undergo two proficiency checks every 12 months and perform three takeoffs and landings every 90 days. They‚Äôre also subject to examinations from doctors specializing in aviation medicine.When the pandemic began, ICAO allowed airlines flexibility in meeting these rules because the virus was devastating enough, as long as carriers incorporated other safeguards. But with flying on its way back, the Montreal-based agency says it‚Äôs becoming less lenient.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going to be a point beyond which you can‚Äôt stretch standards,‚Äù said Ian Knowles, a technical officer within ICAO‚Äôs air navigation bureau, which leads the agency‚Äôs response to crises. ‚ÄúStandards are there for a reason.‚ÄùEven so, ICAO is still offering 41 exemptions from the standards in 11 countries including Cambodia, Nigeria and Pakistan, according to its website. Air Niugini in Papua New Guinea, for example, has been allowed to stretch its pilot-proficiency checks to 12-month intervals because Covid restrictions make it difficult to access flight simulators in nearby Australia and Singapore. Pilots at the airline must instead undergo more theoretical and practical training to compensate, details of the exemption show.Knowles, who was a British Airways pilot before joining ICAO, concedes that just meeting ICAO requirements is no guarantee of performance.‚ÄúYou could still be needing that extra edge,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere is a certain loss of confidence and ability that comes with even maintaining the very bare minimum.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs this element of human variation that makes it hard for regulators to get a handle on the risks posed by recently returned pilots, and the many who are yet to make a comeback.While commercial flying in the US is 17% off normal levels, activity in Western Europe remains down 35%, according to OAG. The shortfalls are even greater in the Middle East, Southern Africa and Southeast Asia, where many international borders remain shut.In interviews, some pilots who have returned to work report a loss of the muscle memory that once helped them follow procedures on the flight deck without pause. Others wonder if they still possess the clear-mindedness to handle a mid-air crisis.A senior pilot for Qantas Airways Ltd, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said colleagues who haven‚Äôt flown for six months typically make one or two minor procedural errors on their return.They might forget to enter data into the flight computer at the appropriate time, or land the plane harder than normal, the pilot said. Actions that were once immediate and instinctive require more time and thought. That‚Äôs after refresher sessions in a flight simulator, the pilot said.‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs an engine failure or a fire, then you have to implement that procedure,‚Äù said Amit Singh, a former head of pilot training at Indian airline IndiGo who founded not-for-profit organization Safety Matters. ‚ÄúIf you haven‚Äôt flown for a long time, it may take you a few minutes or seconds extra.‚ÄùDespite the mistakes made by pilots since the pandemic, IATA, major regulators and some of the largest airlines insist the risks are under control.‚ÄúAs the crisis has continued, mitigations to risks that emerged over the past 18 months are getting stronger and more robust,‚Äù IATA‚Äôs safety director Mark Searle said.The FAA said in a statement that its ‚Äúcomprehensive data-driven safety oversight system enables the agency to detect risks and address problems early, including any that may result from pilots returning to work after Covid-related furloughs.‚ÄùAnd American Airlines Group and Delta Air Lines, two of the biggest US carriers, say their pilot training exceeds regulatory requirements.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency, meanwhile, said it had identified ‚Äúa small number‚Äù of incidents potentially linked to pilot proficiency. Although it warned of the dangers when pilots lose even a little flying ability in August, EASA said in a statement it sees no need for further action.Yet crew who have come back on duty with little recent flying experience have already come close to disaster. In September last year, a Lion Air Group plane carrying 307 passengers veered off the runway after landing at Medan in northern Indonesia. The pilot had flown less than three hours in the previous 90 days.No one was injured and it‚Äôs true that serious incidents in aviation in general remain very rare. There was just one major accident for every 5 million jet flights between 2016 and 2020, according to IATA‚Äôs latest Safety Report.Evidence, however, suggests more oversight is needed in certain regions. Many of the safeguards against a lack of proficiency, such as rostering more-experienced crew in the cockpit and running additional simulator sessions, represent an additional cost ‚Äî one that airlines under financial stress may struggle to foot.Sydney-based Qantas, which has one of the strongest balance sheets of any airline despite the pandemic, dedicated an entire team to addressing pilot rustiness. Staff combed through research on other professions with similar skill sets to pilots and eventually found helpful parallels in surgery.The research showed that the fine motor skills of surgeons withstood long periods out of theater. But it was different when surgeons had to complete a list of procedures or apply previously acquired knowledge.With that evidence, Qantas now puts its Boeing Co 737 pilots through a six-day course before they get back in the sky, and a senior training captain sits in on their initial flights. The airline‚Äôs A380 pilots have two days of training on the ground and in the simulator every 90 days, even though Qantas hasn‚Äôt yet resumed flying the enormous jets.‚ÄúWe realized very early on that we needed to think differently,‚Äù Qantas Chief Pilot Dick Tobiano said. ‚ÄúThe data has shown that our pilots are coming back with the skills and confidence to do their job safely.‚ÄùAt Indonesia‚Äôs Lion Air, however, a senior captain speaking on condition of anonymity said he‚Äôs so concerned about his colleagues‚Äô flying ability that he‚Äôs scaled back his own flying hours. Indonesia has one of the world‚Äôs poorest safety records with 105 accidents and 2,356 related fatalities, worse than Mexico and Venezuela, Aviation Safety Network data from 1945 through October show.The captain said he had to take over the controls approaching Semarang‚Äôs Ahmad Yani International Airport in Central Java during a flight mid last year. The junior pilot flying the plane hadn‚Äôt worked for three months and failed to notice the aircraft wasn‚Äôt locked into the airport‚Äôs landing guidance system. Lion Air didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment.That may sound minor but the number of badly executed landings worldwide ‚Äî coming in too high and too fast, for instance ‚Äî almost tripled from pre-pandemic levels to 35 out of every 1,000 by May 2020, according to the UK‚Äôs own confidential safety incident reporting program.It‚Äôs important because more than half of all fatal commercial-jet accidents from 2011 through 2020 occurred on a plane‚Äôs final approach to landing or the landing itself, research from Boeing shows. At lower altitudes, pilots have limited height and therefore less time to recover from an error or mechanical failure.Indeed, some of the errors declared by pilots in the ASRS database have echoes in the most grim airline disasters.In June last year, a first officer for an airline in the US who hadn‚Äôt flown in nearly three months forgot to switch on the anti-icing mechanism for the plane‚Äôs airspeed sensors. In 2009, those same sensors iced up and triggered the crash of Air France Flight 447 on its way to Paris from Rio de Janeiro, killing all 228 people aboard.The solution, according to Lufthansa pilot Harter, involves going beyond the pre-pandemic standards of pilot proficiency. Rather than prescribing enough training to meet requirements, airlines and regulators must give crew whatever they need to feel comfortable again, whether that‚Äôs more time in a simulator or the acknowledgment there may be a mental component that extra rules can‚Äôt always adequately address.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the way forward,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs not written in any regulation.‚Äù","‚ÄúThe regulations that we have aren‚Äôt sufficient.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs not as if authorities are blind to this.

402,Road Accidents in India - Goa Chronicle,"According to a report by World Bank, India has a mere 1% of the world‚Äôs vehicles but accounts for 11% of the global deaths due to road accidents, which is highest in the world! Undoubtedly, road accidents in India are a much more inimical enemy than the deadly virus.

Every year, India witnesses more than 4.5 lakh road crashes, in which 1.5 lakh people die. As per the World Bank report there happen 53 road crashes every hour in India, taking a toll on 1 person‚Äôs life every 4 minutes! All through the last decade, 50 lakh Indians got injured in road accidents while a whopping 13 lakh lost their lives.

According to a recent study commissioned by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), the socio- economic costs of road crashes at Rs. 1, 47, 114 crore in India, which is equivalent to 0.77% of the country‚Äôs GDP.As per the ministry, 76.2% of the people who lose their lives in road crashes are in their prime working age that is 18- 45 years.

All through 2019, a total of 1, 51, 113 people were killed in 4, 80, 652 road accidents, an average of 414 deaths a day or 17 deaths per hour. In 2019, India continued to account for the largest number of road fatalities in the world, followed by China with 63, 093 deaths in 2, 12, 846 accidents. While the USA recorded the highest number of road crashes- 22, 11, 439 in which 37, 461 deaths were reported in the same year.

While the leading cause of road crashes and deaths was found out to be speeding, two- wheelers were involved in most of the fatalities. The highest number of road accidents was witnessed by Tamil Nadu (57, 228), followed by Madhya Pradesh (50, 669), Uttar Pradesh (42, 572), Kerala (41, 111) and Karnataka (40, 658).

As far as road fatalities among cities was concerned, Delhi retained its first rank in 2019 with 1, 463 deaths, followed by Jaipur (1, 283 deaths), Chennai (1, 252 deaths) and Bengaluru (768 deaths).

According to the World Bank, the road crash fatality rate is three- times higher in low-income countries compared to high income countries. The report stated, ‚ÄúThere is a distinct correlation between socio- economic status and road use patterns in low and middle income countries and poor people are more likely to be involved in a road traffic crash.‚Äù

In a country like India, the income level of an individual directly determines the mode of transport used by the person; and vulnerable road users are forced to share space with other less vulnerable users. This therefore increases the amount of risk faced by a particular road user. The World Bank report also stated that daily wage workers and casual labourers are more prone to be defined as vulnerable as compared to individuals engaged in regular activities.

Thus, the vulnerable road users constitute of poor male users coming from the working age category and these users account for more than half of all the road crash fatalities and injuries in India.

It is the ultimate fact of the matter that majority of these accidents are caused by human negligence and a callous attitude while on the roads. All through our childhood, teachers have taught us to follow the traffic rules and be a responsible citizen and an alert driver, alas, we tend to forget the values and rules as we grow up and that results into Indians turning into irresponsible citizens with a dearth of civic sense. Now this doesn‚Äôt mean that only the drivers ought to be responsible, many a time, the drivers follow the traffic rules, it is the pedestrian who is at fault; therefore, as Indians we literally need to learn to walk while on the roads too!

Nevertheless, one of the major causes which lead to road crashes is distracted driving. Driving needs undivided attention; READING OR REPLYING TO TEXTS, ATTENDING CALLS, LISTENING TO SONGS CAN WAIT! What good will these things do if you lose your life?

Another dangerous cause of the same is driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. DO NOT DRINK AND DRIVE! Kindly take a cab home if you‚Äôve had a drink or let your sober friend drive. Don‚Äôt think that you won‚Äôt be intoxicated after partying the whole night! On another note, TRY QUITTING ALCOHOL AND DRUGS! They are anyhow perilous to your health and life!

Most of the accidents on road occur due to speeding. Reckless driving leads to the most horrible of crashes, DO NOT THINK YOU LOOK ‚ÄòCOOL‚Äô WHILE YOU HIT THE THROTTLE OR PUSH THE ACCELERATOR FURTHER. The speed might thrill you but it can anytime kill you! Also important is time management- try to be on time. Mostly, people need to rush to offices or any other location where they are expected to be because they‚Äôre running late. Try to reach places on time; you won‚Äôt be needed to turn into a formula 1 racer then!

There are two things of utmost importance whose very existence is ignored by Indians on road- your helmet or seat belt! Kindly wear your helmet if on a two- wheeler; your hairstyle won‚Äôt save your life, your helmet will. Similarly, why can‚Äôt we wear a seat belt while driving a car? Not only it keeps our body posture straight but also prevents the chances of fatalities in case of a head to head collision. HOW DO YOU THINK IT‚ÄôLL FEEL WITH THE STEERING WHEEL BREAKING INTO YOUR RIBCAGE? Definitely not a pretty sight to imagine or a sensation worth enjoying!

Lastly, traffic rules are meant to follow and not only be studied during school! A single and simple broken rule can lead to massive havoc, KINDLY KEEP ALL YOUR EXCUSES ASIDE AND FOLLOW THE RULES, the reason to rush can wait but your life won‚Äôt wait before it bids goodbye!

403,Road accidents in India down by 35% this year,"The number of road accidents in the first six months of the year (January to June) were around 1,60,000, 35% less than the average number of accidents reported in the corresponding period in the previous six years, an obvious result of a nationwide lockdown imposed in March to slow the spread of the Covid-19 infection. The number of people who died also dropped by 30% this year.

The information on the accidents was provided by the government in Parliament on Thursday.

On an average, nearly 2,48,000 road accidents were reported between January and June each year between 2014 and 2019. The month-wise breakup of accidents for the previous years is from annual reports on road accidents published by the ministry of road transport and highways, and annual reports on accidental deaths and suicides published by the ministry of home affairs. (See chart 1)

There was a drop in the number of road accidents between 2019 and 2020 in all states and union territories except three small northeastern states ‚Äì Meghalaya, Sikkim and Nagaland. Among big states, the largest percentage drop in the number of road accidents was seen in Karnataka (48%). Delhi reported a 46% drop in accidents this year. (See chart 2)

The 68-day long nationwide lockdown imposed in the last week of March, reduced traffic and mobility in the months of April and May. Even in June, many parts of the country were under localised lockdowns, and many business, merchant and recreational establishments continued to be closed. The number of accidents from April to June this year (50,336) was 55% less than the corresponding number last year (1,12,215).

In terms of fatalities in road accidents, 56,288 people died in the first six months of this year compared to 79,678 in the same period last year, a drop of about 30%.

In the April to June period, the number of fatalities in road accidents dropped by nearly 51% compared to the same period in 2019, which is about 20,000 less fatalities.","On an average, nearly 2,48,000 road accidents were reported between January and June each year between 2014 and 2019.

404,India recorded highest number of road accident deaths across the globe in 2019 as well,"India recorded highest number of road accident deaths across the globe in 2019 as well

Key Highlights A total of 449,002 accidents occurred in India in 2019 151,113 people were killed and 451,361 were injured due to road accidents last year National Highways accounted for an inordinate share of deaths yet again

Another year, another 'Road Accidents in India' report by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. If we had to sum it all up in one line, we would say 'It is still not looking good'. Sure enough, the total number of road accidents in India declined 3.86 per cent in 2019, but we still ranked first in the world for the total number of road accident deaths. India, in fact, accounted for roughly 11 per cent of the total accident related deaths in the world. A total 449,002 accidents occurred in India in 2019, causing 151,113 deaths and 451,361 injuries.

Yet another worrying trend that reared its head again in the Road Accidents in India in 2019 report had to do with National Highways, account for 2.03 percent of the total road network in the country. The report notes that National Highways accounted for an inordinate share of 35.7 per cent of deaths last year. This is not news though, i.e. the national highways in India have always been one a sore spot, with a disproportiante share in the total number of road accident deaths in the country.

Clearly, we need to do better when it comes to road safety on National Highways. Besides that, state highways, which account for 3.01 per cent of India's road length, accounted for 24.8 per cent road accident deaths, followed by other roads contributing the remaining 39 per cent.

If you thought that was bad enough, here's a look at another statistic that should scare everyone: Over-speeding contributed 67.3 per cent of the total road accident deaths in India last year, followed by driving on the wrong side of the road and drink driving, accounting for 6 per cent and 3.5 per cent of accident deaths, respectively.

What is even more concerning is the fact that road accidents, deaths, and persons killed owing to over-speeding, drink driving, and driving on the wrong side -- all of them recorded growth as compared to figures from 2018. And people thought the Motor Vehicle Act 2019 is ""excessive"". Clearly, neither is it execessive nor is its enforcement robust enough. Not yet, at least.","India recorded highest number of road accident deaths across the globe in 2019 as wellKey Highlights A total of 449,002 accidents occurred in India in 2019 151,113 people were killed and 451,361 were injured due to road accidents last year National Highways accounted for an inordinate share of deaths yet againAnother year, another 'Road Accidents in India' report by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.

405,At least 13 auto safety rules are years overdue,"WASHINGTON: After their 16-year-old daughter died in a car crash, David and Wendy Mills wondered whether she would be alive if federal rules on rear seat belt warnings had been issued on time.Four years later, with no rule and traffic fatalities spiking, they're still at a loss over the inaction.The teenager was riding in the back seat of a car to a Halloween party in 2017 just a mile from her house in Spring, Texas, when she unfastened her seat belt to slide next to her friend and take a selfie. Moments later, the driver veered off the road and the car flipped, ejecting her.Kailee died instantly. Her three friends who remained buckled walked away with minor scrapes.A 2012 law had directed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an agency of the Department of Transportation, to implement safety rules requiring car manufacturers to install a warning to drivers if an unbuckled passenger is sitting in a rear seat. The agency had three years to act.But the regulation wasn't done when Kailee climbed into her friend's car, though it's been estimated that it could save hundreds of lives each year. It's one of more than a dozen car safety rules now years overdue, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.The ever-growing docket has become one of the biggest tests for the federal agency since its founding in 1970, when public pressure led by safety activist Ralph Nader spurred NHTSA 's mission to ""save lives, prevent injuries and reduce economic costs due to road traffic crashes.""Advocates worry that the agency has lost focus and risks getting bogged down under President Joe Biden, at a time of increasing road accidents and reckless driving during the COVID-19 pandemic.""We need a call to action,"" said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association. He called the pandemic surge in accidents a ""car crash epidemic.""The rules backlog would only increase with the sweeping technological requirements included in a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill pending in Congress, from new breathalyzer devices that would disable a car if a driver is drunk to stiffer standards for reporting safety recalls.Currently, the 600-employee federal agency lacks a permanent leader. Its acting administrator is Steven Cliff, a former deputy executive officer at the California Air Resources Board, which regulates auto emissions, a key component of Biden's climate agenda.""Government should not take this long to act on safety,"" said David Mills, who started a Houston-area foundation in Kailee's honor aimed at promoting seat belt safety. The foundation keeps a list, known as ""Kailee's Angels,"" of some of the teenagers around the country who died in car crashes after failing to buckle up.""It's devastating to families,"" he said.The rear seat belt reminder requirement is now scheduled to start moving through the cumbersome regulatory process in January, but a final rule could be years away. The agency in the past has repeatedly blown past deadlines, including those promised in federal court.The AP review of NHTSA's rule-making activities under the last three presidents found at least 13 auto safety rules that are years overdue based on deadlines set in laws passed by Congress.In most cases, those rules are opposed by powerful industries as expensive, outdated or restrictive. Other pending rules have been slowed by the bureaucracy or taken a back seat to other priorities under Democratic presidents. For example, a 2011 initiative that large commercial vehicles be equipped with devices to limit their speed was recently put on indefinite hold by Biden.President Donald Trump sidetracked at least four major road safety proposals, including medical evaluations of commercial truck drivers for sleep apnea.Pending rules include side-impact standards for child car seats, originally due in 2014. Attorneys general of 17 states and the District of Columbia wrote to the Biden administration in July, urging immediate action. Other pending rules would require car manufacturers to maintain records of safety defects for at least 10 years, as required by Congress and originally due in 2017, and anti-ejection protection measures for larger buses, due in 2014.Standards for ""smart"" car headlights, begun in 2018, are incomplete despite car industry support. Smart headlights would adjust a high intensity light to oncoming traffic, so drivers don't have to toggle between high and low beams.NHTSA declined to make Cliff available for comment. The agency instead released a list of steps it has taken to address auto safety, including recently announced proposed fuel economy standards that Biden has promoted to confront climate change.The agency points in part to plans to require or set standards for automatic emergency braking systems on new passenger vehicles and heavy trucks, a reversal from the Trump administration, and to move forward on some of the delayed regulations, though it did not offer firm guarantees on timing.NHTSA has pledged to require what it said are rigorous testing standards for autonomous vehicles and set up a national database to document automated-vehicle crashes. It has prodded electric vehicle maker Tesla to recall dark touch screens and is investigating the company's Autopilot partially automated driving system's failure to stop for parked emergency vehicles.In recent public remarks, Cliff said the agency is committed to address rising traffic fatalities and he stressed a ""transformational and collaborative approach to safety.""Jason Levine, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, and other consumer groups have been urging Biden to quickly nominate an agency leader. The last Senate-confirmed NHTSA administrator served under President Barack Obama until 2017.""You have a Biden administration it seems across the board more interested in acting in a regulatory fashion than the previous administration,"" Levine said. ""That's why there's so much excitement, but also quite frankly frustration that things aren't moving with a greater sense of urgency.""The Alliance for Auto Innovation, which is the trade association representing all auto manufacturers but Tesla, declined to comment for this story.Automakers have made some progress on safety issues on their own or in voluntary agreements with the government. For instance, 20 companies agreed with NHTSA in 2016 to make automatic emergency braking standard on at least 95% of their new passenger vehicles by Sept. 1, 2022. At least 10 have already met the goal. Two years ago, 20 auto companies agreed to install electronic reminders to check back seats so drivers don't leave children in hot cars. The industry would install the reminders in new vehicles by the 2025 model year.The Governors Highway Safety Association has been strongly pushing for rear seat belt reminders since 2015, noting back then that fewer passengers were buckling up in the back when riding in increasingly popular Uber, Lyft and other for-hire vehicles.Last year, over half of all crash fatalities involved unbelted drivers or occupants, the highest level since 2012, according to NHTSA.An estimated 38,680 people were killed in traffic crashes in 2020, the highest total since 2007, even though total miles driven dropped due to stay-at-home orders at the beginning of the pandemic. In the first three months of 2021, 8,730 people died in motor vehicle traffic crashes, a 10.5% increase from the same period last year.More than 800 people who were unbelted in the back seat die in car crashes each year, and an analysis of NHTSA's data by the governors' group found that wearing seat belts would have saved more than half of them.Those grim statistics and rising fatalities have spurred states in recent months to seek ways to boost seat belt use, such as with ""Click it or Ticket"" law enforcement campaigns. In Connecticut, a law signed by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont took effect this month that requires all rear seat passengers 16 and older to wear a seat belt. Those under 16 already had been required to buckle up.Adkins said state highway safety officials were heartened to see Biden elevate Jennifer Homendy, a former congressional staffer and member of the National Transportation Safety Board who has spent two decades working on transportation safety, to NTSB chair. In recent months, she's appeared with Lamont to promote the new rear seat belt law, railed against Tesla's ""misleading"" marketing that she says puts lives at risk and called for stronger federal safety standards.But as NTSB head, she has no actual regulatory authority, and the buzz at a recent governors' safety conference was the impact she could have if she were NHTSA's administrator.""We need a NHTSA administrator who is confirmed and has the political ability to get some things done,"" Adkins said. ""There's no time for a learning curve. We're in a bad spot in traffic safety. We've got work to do. And we need the administration's attention.""Various NHTSA delays have led to a patchwork of safety features initiated by the auto industry that have no clear minimum level of standards, said Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. Many of the features also are typically sold in high-end cars or luxury packages, in effect imposing an ""upcharge"" for consumer safety.She noted that a 2008 congressional mandate to install backup cameras in passenger vehicles took NHTSA 10 years and a lawsuit by her group and others before the rule was finally implemented; the original deadline was 2011.Meanwhile, the European Union began requiring seat belt reminder systems in the front and rear seats of new cars in September 2019.""I can't say the U.S. regulator of the auto industry is at all on track,"" Chase said. ""We're years behind at this point. I don't want to be critical because they are still in their first year, but the infancy of the new administration will soon expire, and it's time for them to move forward.""","""Government should not take this long to act on safety,"" said David Mills, who started a Houston-area foundation in Kailee's honor aimed at promoting seat belt safety.

406,IIT researchers working on first-of-its kind smart speed warning system to avoid crashes related to,"Researchers at different Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are working on development of a first-of-its kind ""smart speed warning system"" for vehicles which will alert the driver on the basis of road infrastructure and geographical location to avoid over-speeding related crashes.

According to statistics available with the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, about 70 per cent of road fatalities in India occur due to over-speeding.

To minimise such fatalities, the government had mandated that all new cars sold from July 1, 2019, should include a speed governor device that will generate intermittent warning beeps for above 80 kmph and the constant beep for above 120 kmph for drivers. To further reduce damage to lives, the fine for speeding was increased by ten times under the new Motor Vehicles Act of 2019.

However, the researchers at IIT Guwahati and Bombay believe the current speed governing device is a ""one size fits all"" solution and does not have much intelligence and the same system cannot effectively work while driving in hilly terrains, plains or desert areas.

""Our studies revealed the safe speed for a vehicle can significantly vary with changes in road geometry like on sharp or blind curves or hairpin bends. Therefore, there is a need to develop a smart speed warning system incorporating a dynamic and adaptable speed threshold based on upcoming road infrastructure to avoid overspeeding-related crashes,"" Akhilesh Kumar Maurya, Civil Engineering Professor at IIT Guwahati, told PTI.

""Traditional warning systems are based on the fixed speed threshold, however, the concept of a smart warning system is based on upcoming road infrastructure and vehicle location. On approaching curves along a roadway, including blind curves or hairpin bends, vehicles equipped with such a system will warn drivers in advance, which will allow drivers to adopt corrective actions and avoid accidents,"" he added. The researchers, who are in process of filing a patent for the system, claim that such a system is not available anywhere across the globe.

According to the team, algorithm for the smart speed warning system was developed based on the field data collected from a 45 km stretch of four-lane highway (NH-40) between Jorabat in Assam and Nongpoh in Meghalaya, consisting of 285 horizontal curves. The study section covered a broader range of road geometry (curve radius ranges from 20-800m, curve length varies from 30-244 m and gradient varied from seven per cent to nine per cent.

""We are in the process of analysing data of two-lane undivided highway NH-61 between Mumbai and Malshej Ghat in Maharashtra. We have now completed our pilot studies along four-lane divided highway, NH-160 between Thane and Nashik (Maharashtra) and now planning to collect detailed data very soon,"" Maurya said.

The team plans to conduct similar pilot studies at different highways across the country to get an idea of different geographical locations and present the model ultimately to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).

During the pilot studies of speed prediction model development, the researchers came up with car speed model and HCV and LCV speed model.

According to Avijit Maji, Associate Professor at IIT Bombay's Civil Engineering department, researchers have used operating speed of vehicles as one of the surrogate measures for safety evaluation of horizontal curves ""Now, the 85th percentile speed of vehicles in free-flow condition is widely considered as the operating speed. However, the geometric features of highways are designed on the basis of design speed. Some studies pointed out that the design speed might be represented by 95th to 98th percentile speed of vehicles in free-flow condition,"" he described in a paper published in the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) journal.

""Drivers in developing nations are not well disciplined and often drive solely based on their perception of the road geometry. Hence, the 98th percentile vehicle speed can be useful in evaluating safety of a highway section in such country. Now, the available vehicle speed prediction models vary widely. Differences in driver behaviour and highway geometry might be the reasons for these variations,"" he added. Another research scholar from the team asserted that studies show that the decision-making process and driver performance greatly depends on situational awareness.

""Drivers intend to operate vehicles at safe speed based on the roadway geometric features. These features are characterised by gradient, horizontal curvature, length of curves and tangent sections, superelevation, etc. Perceptive and consistent geometric characteristics of the roadway can ease the decision making burden and thus minimise driver error.

""So far, majority of the studies on geometric design consistency are conducted on isolated curve sections in plain terrain for traffic with strong lane discipline. The effect of gradient is not significant in these terrains. Further, the driving behaviour of traffic with weak lane discipline is not represented in these studies,"" he described.

407,"‚ÄòThere were bodies everywhere‚Äô: Survivors recall accident‚Äôs chaotic aftermath, ponder what-ifs","About three kilometres from the site of an accident in Barabanki district‚Äôs Ram Sanehi Ghat area where 18 migrant workers were killed the night before, several buses stood parked at a government school on Wednesday, ready to take survivors back home in Bihar. People and administrative officials scrambled to ensure no one was left behind.

Among those waiting to board a bus to Saharsa district were 28-year-old Subhash Sada, his wife Raviya, the couple‚Äôs two young children, and Subhash‚Äôs brother Neeraj (18). ‚ÄúKal raat ka jo haal tha shayad main kabhi nahi bhool paunga [I will never be able to forget the scene from last night],‚Äù Subhash muttered.

Subhash, Raviya, and Neeraj are labourers at a construction site in Ambala in Haryana. They travel to Haryana every three months because of higher wages, and return to Bihar with their earnings. Recalling the horrific accident, the family said it survived ‚Äúbecause of luck while several others did not‚Äù.

Subhash said they boarded the bus from Ambala. ‚ÄúThe driver said it would cost Rs 1,400 per adult and we agreed as the bus was air-conditioned and looked good. After the bus left Ambala, there were 80-90 people on the bus. But then, somewhere near Karnal, the driver stopped the bus and asked us to get off at a restaurant and said the bus had to be cleaned. Everyone got off. But around half an hour later, the driver said some more people would board the bus, and some of us protested. But, by then we had already paid, so we had to travel. After the new set of people boarded, it became very crowded. On one berth, at least six people were seated and it was very crowded.‚Äù

As her children clinged on to her, Raviya recalled that the bus broke down in Barabanki around 8.30 pm. ‚ÄúThe driver then tried to fix it himself, but he struggled for one hour and nothing happened. Because it was so hot, most people got off the bus and started walking around on the highway. Then later, some sat while some also lay down to rest, which is what proved to be fatal,‚Äù she said.

While Raviya was recollecting what happened, 24-year-old Seema, who was travelling in the vehicle with her husband Sanjay (26), interjected. ‚ÄúThose who were sitting or lying down closer to the bus were severely injured. I was sitting around 30-40 metres from the bus and that is why I am here. Others who sat closer came under the bus.‚Äù The couple are from Bihar‚Äôs Araria district, and work as construction workers in Panchkula in Haryana.

Officials said there were almost 150 people on the bus, far in excess of its capacity. Around 11.30 pm, a truck rammed into the bus from behind on the Ayodhya-Lucknow highway, sending it hurtling forward. Those who were sitting close to the bus got crushed.

Said Seema, ‚ÄúI saw that the bus ran over people who were sitting 10 metres from it. The scene was scary. It was dark. There were bodies and injured people everywhere on the road. Everyone was struggling to find their loved ones and some of them found dead bodies. I still shake thinking about it.‚Äù

She added, ‚ÄúBefore the policemen came, we were trying to stop cars passing by and asking for help. None stopped, and then we had to line up bodies on the highway to get the attention of people passing by.‚Äù

Some survivors were left thinking about the what-ifs. Anil Mandal, 22, who works as a farmhand in Chandigarh, lost his uncles Balram (55) and Rajnath (40) in the accident. Sitting on a bus that will take him back home in Supaul district, he told The Indian Express that he never wanted to get on the ill-fated vehicle. But he was part of a group of nine relatives and was overruled.

‚ÄúIt became too crowded, and I told the people I was travelling with to not get on the bus. But when you travel with a big group, you have to listen to everyone else, and especially the elders. They [those in charge of the bus] made us sit like sheep in the bus. It was hard to breathe after the bus was stopped because the windows couldn‚Äôt be opened because of the air conditioning. I didn‚Äôt want to travel after the new set of people were made to board the bus in Karnal, but they said we would not get our money back.‚Äù

Anil said he survived because he was a bit further away from the parked bus than his uncles. He added, ‚ÄúBalram chacha‚Äôs son has gone to identify the bodies and take them back. I will reach earlier so I can handle the situation at home.‚Äù

Anil‚Äôs cousin and Balram‚Äôs son Sanjay (25) sat expressionless under a tree outside the district hospital mortuary, around 35 km from the district school. He will now have to travel 700 km to take home the bodies of his father and uncle.

‚ÄúAfter the truck came and hit the parked bus, there was a loud noise. After that, it was chaos. I don‚Äôt remember much,‚Äù said Sanjay, who too works at a paddy field in Chandigarh like Anil.

He added, ‚ÄúIf there was work in Bihar, we would have stayed there and not left. But the daily wage in Bihar is half of what we get in Haryana and Punjab ‚Äî around Rs 500-600 for a day‚Äôs work. Hence, we risk everything and go so far. It is all for money and pet [stomach].‚Äù","‚ÄúThe driver said it would cost Rs 1,400 per adult and we agreed as the bus was air-conditioned and looked good.

410,"Exposed At Sea, Fishers Need Better Insurance To Manage Climate Risks","Mumbai: Rufino Possa, 52, a fisher from Uttan, a coastal village in north Mumbai, returned home on October 2, after 12 days at sea, four days more than he planned. The rough seas churned up by Cyclone Gulab towards the end of September meant that he could not find any catch. ""Each trip costs us more than Rs 1 lakh, we cannot afford to come back without any catch,"" he said.



Possa, like others of the fishing community, is still to recover from the losses caused by the pandemic. But their problem is further aggravated by the frequent and intense cyclones and torrential rains that have been battering India's coastline over the last few years. When Possa and his 12-member crew now launch their boats, they are not sure they will return home safely. A few days ago, one of his friends lost a member of his crew at sea. The body was later found floating at a harbour in Palghar district, around 80 km north of Uttan.





Rufino Possa, 50, came back from the sea after 12 days. ""Each trip costs us more than Rs 1 lakh, we cannot afford to come back without any catch,"" he said. Right: A crew member on Possa's boat is carrying a big fish they caught in. Photo credit: Flavia Lopes ""I have been in the fishing business for the last 30 years but have never faced so much loss and damage at sea as I have in the last few years,"" said Possa. Unexpected summer rains this year also damaged Rs 2-lakh worth of fish he had put out to dry.



Leo Colaco runs a fishing co-operative society in Uttan, the Uttan Machimar Vikas Society Ltd. Its 115 members now frequently seek help with insurance claims, loans and subsidies, he said. ""The fishing business has become even more precarious after these frequent weather events like cyclones and heavy rains,"" said Colaco. India's 8,000-km coastline is a source of livelihood for almost 28 million workers in the fishing sector, including those vendors, boat owners and operators, 'ice breakers' who ensure that the catch is kept iced, drivers and owners of vehicles used to transport the catch and so on. Among them, close to 67% live below the poverty line, according to the 2016 National Marine Fisheries Census conducted by the government-run Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute ( CMFRI ). Unusual extreme weather events are being witnessed along India's coast. For example, in May 2021, a severe cyclonic storm Tauktae landed on India's west coast though cyclonic storms are rarely formed in the Arabian Sea and this can be traced to the warming of oceans, we reported in May 2021. Coastal climate disasters can impact the livelihood of fishers in multiple ways--they not only cause death and injuries at sea but also loss of or damage to expensive fishing gear, large-scale decline in the haul, and damage to assets such as aquaculture farms, marine cages used in aquaculture, storage infrastructure and so on. These losses are not covered under conventional insurance schemes. Currently, fishers have access to insurance against accidents, death and certain other kinds of losses. The Centre offers group accident insurance that provides coverage against accident or death at sea to entire fishing crews. Insurance is also available for total destruction or loss of fishing vessels from public insurance companies such as the New India Assurance Company Ltd, Oriental Insurance Company Ltd and United India Insurance Company Ltd. Some private insurers also compensate for loss of fishing gear at an extra premium. ""There is an increasing loss of workdays, loss and damage of vessels, property, and mortality on account of adverse climatic conditions. This is not matched by the current levels of risk-coverage provided under these schemes,"" said Adithya Pillai of Dakshin Foundation, a Bengaluru-based research organisation working on marine conservation and environment sustainability. Need for measures to deal with climate shocks The agriculture ministry did introduce a weather-based index insurance scheme in 2003 but only to benefit farmers. In 2016, the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana or the PM's crop insurance scheme began to cover crop losses caused by adverse weather, replacing the weather index insurance. However, there is no equivalent scheme for the fisheries sector. What can be done to help livelihoods impacted by disasters precipitated by climate change? In a February 2021 report , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations asked national governments to come up with social security measures to help fishers recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and the exacerbated climatic events. ""Income-support programmes and better social support systems help absorb systemic shocks like natural disasters, or Covid, that increase overall vulnerability and negative coping strategies,"" said Pillai of Dakshin Foundation. ""Insurance schemes need to be suited to the level of occupational risks, uncertainties and ability of fishers to provide collateral and pay premiums."" Several western countries have designed a weather index insurance to cover climate risks such as excess rainfall or droughts that impact specific populations. In 2007, 23 countries in central America and the Caribbean formed a Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility , a multi-country insurance instrument to cover the financial impact of natural hazards like tropical cyclones, earthquakes and excess rainfall. The instrument also has a specific fisheries policy, the Caribbean Ocean and Aquaculture Sustainability Facility ( COAST ) that insures fishing vessels, fishing equipment and fishing infrastructure against extreme weather events. Climate risk insurance is being promoted by organisations to support vulnerable communities and compensate them for unavoidable risks such as extreme weather events. Partial protection against climate vagaries Apart from one-time compensations provided under disaster relief funds, which we detail later, fishers also have access to accident insurance schemes provided by the Centre and state governments such as the Group Accident Insurance Scheme for Fishermen under the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana . In 2020, the central government came up with another insurance scheme under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) that gives greater coverage between Rs 25,000 and Rs 5 lakh for accidental injuries or deaths of fishers. However, such state and central schemes do not cover loss and damage caused by extreme weather events, said Shinoj P., a senior scientist at CMFRI. And, apart from accident risks, other big risks in the sector such as loss and damage to fishing vessels, gear and assets of fishers are only partially covered by private entities, he said. As we said earlier, India's coastline has been hit by successive disasters in recent years. In 2020, four cyclones hit different coastal parts of India: Amphan hit the east in May, Nisarga landed in Maharashtra in June, Nivar swept coastal south-east in November and Burevi impacted Tamil Nadu and Kerala in early December. The frequency of cyclones in all oceans surrounding India has increased: both 2018 and 2019 recorded seven cyclones, higher than the annual long-period average (1961-2017) of 4.5, we reported in December 2020.

Lynel Mallekar, 40, a fisher from Uttan, has had to deal with the impact of several such weather events. He had bought a new boat in 2019 but it has already undergone six or seven major repairs costing a total of Rs 4 lakh. The boat itself cost him Rs 20 lakh.



Though the vessel is insured, Mallekar could not recover the cost of repairs. ""Vessel insurances in India cover only total loss, which means that only if your boat disappears can you claim Rs 1-2 lakh for a Rs 10-50 lakh loss,"" said Colaco, head of the fisher collective in Uttan, who has appointed an insurance clerk for the cooperative. Delayed payment Apart from vessel insurance offered by public insurance companies, accident/death insurance schemes for fishers are largely covered under state and central insurance programmes. The centre's Group Accidental Insurance Scheme for Active Fishermen covers life/disability risks of a fishing crew. Under this, the insured can seek Rs 2 lakh in case of permanent disability/accidental death, and Rs 1 lakh in case of partial disability. Investigations into incidents to claim insurance are also time consuming, said Colaco. ""Fishers rarely have time to pursue them,"" he said. Royden Dhokalkar, who lost his crew member in an accident at sea in January 2020, was sanctioned his claim of Rs 1 lakh a year and a half later, in June 2021. Local co-operative societies, like those run by Leo Colaco, have been instrumental in pushing for insurance claims. But loss of life and damage to vessels is not the only risk fishers have to bear, said Narendra Patil, president of the National Fishworkers Forum , a union of small and traditional fishworkers. ""Equipment like large hooks, lines, traps and fishing nets are expensive and every fisher invests around Rs 1 lakh in a trip. When storms hit or there is no catch, they return home with no income in hand and there is no support available for that,"" he said. 'One-time disaster relief not enough' The Arabian Sea, as we said, no longer enjoys a relatively stable climate due to global warming. The three cyclones to impact it in 2020-21--Amphan, Yaas and Taukate--damaged over 14,000 boats and 78,000 fishing nets , as per the Inter-Ministerial Central Teams constituted by the government. ""But such damage is rarely accounted for in insurance claims,"" said activist Patil.

Disaster relief programmes do offer financial assistance to those whose livelihoods have been hit but these are not in the nature of insurance. ""There are one-time compensation schemes specific to disaster management and mitigation, like relief and rehabilitation of coastal communities affected by floods and cyclones but there aren't insurance schemes that talk explicitly about climate risk and resilience in the fisheries sector,"" said Pillai of Dakshin Foundation. ""Additionally there are some private schemes that help cover damage to fishing vessels and gears, but these insurance schemes still have low levels of coverage.""

412,"Poor enforcement, training: The reasons why there are so many road accidents in India","Road accidents cost India 3-5% of gross domestic product every year, and are avoidable if India could improve its roads and city planning, train its drivers better, and enforce traffic laws properly, an Indiaspend analysis shows.

India‚Äôs young, productive population, aged 18-45 years, is involved in 70% of road accidents, according to data from Road Accidents in India 2018, a report published by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.

Over a period of 24 years from 2014 to 2038, if India could halve the deaths and injuries due to road traffic, its GDP could increase by 7%, a 2018 World Bank report said.

In 2018, India had 467,044 reported road accidents, an increase of 0.5% from 464,910 in 2017, according to the road ministry‚Äôs data.

India has 1% of the world‚Äôs vehicles but accounts for 6% of the world‚Äôs road traffic accidents, according to data from a 2018 World Health Organization report. As many as 73% of all deaths due to road traffic accidents in 2018 in the South and South-East Asia region happened in India, the report said.

Road accidents are one of the 12 most common causes of deaths in India, the ninth most common cause of premature deaths, and the 10th most common reason for disability, according to the 2017 WHO Global Health Estimates.

In 2018, of all road deaths, the most were of those riding two-wheelers (36%), followed by pedestrians (15%), ministry data shows.

Speeding and drink driving

The two most frequent causes of road deaths are speeding and drunk driving, followed by a lack of lane discipline (driving on the wrong side), jumping the red light and the use of a mobile phone while driving, data shows.

Overspeeding is the most common cause of deaths on roads in India, with 64% of road deaths because of speeding. Sixty per cent of the accidents in India occur on highways, mostly because of speeding, said Piyush Tewari from Save a Life Foundation.

The most deaths due to speeding were in Rajasthan (9,618 deaths), followed by Tamil Nadu (9,224 deaths) and Karnataka (8,714 deaths).

The fine for speeding has increased from Rs 500 to Rs 5,000 since September, 2019 under the new Motor Vehicles Act of 2019. In addition, drivers could also be imprisoned for three months for speed racing ‚Äì an illegal race ‚Äì if it is their first offence, and for a period of one year if it is the second offence, according to the law.

The current speed limit in the country is 80 km per hour on a 4-lane highway. However, the WHO has recommended that if we reduce the speed limit to about 55-57 km per hour, we could save around 30%-37% lives, said Patanjali Nayyar, regional advisor for the WHO.

Accidents due to drunk driving ‚Äì under the influence of alcohol or drugs ‚Äì declined by 14% between 2017 and 2018 because of an increase in fines and better implementation of laws, mostly in metro cities, and because of greater media coverage of the issue, according to experts.

The new motor vehicles law increased punishment for the first offence to imprisonment up to six months and/or fine up to Rs 10,000, and for the second offence to two years and/or fine of Rs 15,000. Earlier, the fine was Rs 2,000 or six months for the first offence and Rs 3,000 or two years imprisonment, according to the Motor Vehicles Act 1989.

Poor enforcement

India‚Äôs traffic laws are stricter than those of other countries but these laws are not enforced.

In many other countries, such as the UK, Australia, New Zealand, where they have better enforcement, the alcohol is limit is 0.08 mg/l, higher than the 0.05 mg/l in India, said Nayyar of the WHO. ‚ÄúIn many countries crashes due to alcohol have been reduced due to enforcement of their laws and education.‚Äù

India‚Äôs enforcement of laws on speeding and drunk driving are rated 3 and 4 out of 10, respectively, compared to 8 and 9 in China and 9 (for both) in Sri Lanka, by the Global Road Safety Report 2018, that analysed traffic laws of 175 countries.

India has a paucity of traffic police ‚Äì 30% of 85,144 traffic policemen positions and 39% of 58,509 sanctioned traffic constable positions were vacant in 2018, according to data from the Bureau of Police Research and Development.

Enforcement of laws can reduce drunk driving, said Tewari of Save a Life Foundation, and gave the example of Satyendra Garg, who was the joint commissioner of traffic in New Delhi in 2012 and would conduct random ‚Äúanti-drink and drive drives‚Äù almost every day. Because of the fear of these checks, people stopped drinking and driving, Tewari said. Over 12,000 people were prosecuted for drunk driving in New Delhi in 2011, up from 8,648 in 2010, according to data from the International Road Federation, a global non-profit working on road safety.

‚ÄúWhen it comes to enforcement we know human behaviour is affected by enforcement and in India, enforcement is largely driven by human beings and is prone to corruption,‚Äù said Tewari. He suggests using artificial intelligence, in the form of road sensors to detect speed, and adaptive traffic lighting (in which traffic signal timing changes, or adapts, based on actual traffic demand) for enforcing traffic laws, such as in Sri Lanka and Bhutan.

City planning

On many roads there are no traffic-calming measures such as speed humps before intersections or median barriers, Tewari said.

Roads should be made not just for use by four-wheelers but also for two-wheelers and pedestrians, and towns should be planned not just for expressways and commercial areas but also for hawkers and vendors, Nayyar said. For instance, safer highways should be created by adding underpasses for pedestrians, especially those that are vulnerable, such as pregnant women and the elderly.

Nayyar gave the example of the Delhi-Agra highway where the highway has divided villages, but there are no pedestrian crossings. ‚ÄúHow do we expect people whose village has been divided by that highway to crossover to their fields everyday? There are some villages on this stretch of the highway that are villages of widows due to the deaths caused by road accidents,‚Äù Nayyar said.

Driver training

In 2018, in 26% of all road accidents, drivers who were in an accident did not have a valid license or were driving with a learner‚Äôs license, ministry data shows.

In any case, licences are not a sign that the driver is qualified, experts said.

For example, if we go out and ask drivers about the three-second rule (which ensures driving at a safe speed, and the distance between two vehicles) or whether they are aware of a blindspot in their vehicle while driving, 99% will not know because they have not received any sort of formal training, said Tewari.

‚ÄúBasically we made a road and allowed untrained drivers...Drivers need hard skills training on driving, not just ads and awareness,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe have announced that we will reduce traffic deaths by 50%. This is a joke unless and until we combine efforts in the four E‚Äôs: engineering, enforcement, education, and emergency response,‚Äù Tewari said.

Data management systems

India had about 300,000 road deaths in 2016, almost double the government estimate of 151,000 deaths, according to the 2018 Global Road Safety report of the WHO, highlighting the lack of quality road accident data.

‚ÄúThe data is deeply fractured‚Ä¶ The biggest challenge in data collection in road accidents is the crash investigation report. When a crash occurs very little is done to determine the cause of the crash. Attempt is made to fix the responsibility on the driver of the bigger car,‚Äù said Piyush Tewari.

For instance, in states where alcohol is banned, such as Bihar, Nagaland and Gujarat, there has been a decline in accidents due to drunk driving, data shows.

‚ÄúMy sense is that the more you ban something, the more people are likely to do it,‚Äù Tewari said. But not all states have a good data management system, so they might be under-reporting accidents or not managing the data well, he explained.

‚ÄúThe state of Kerala has banned alcohol, but it also has a very good data recording system,‚Äù Tewari said. In Kerala, drunk driving accidents increased from 35 in 2014 to 133 in 2017. Alcohol was banned in the state between 2014 and 2017.

Goa, with the highest per capita availability of alcohol, had no road deaths due to drunk driving in 2016, which is likely to be because of an error in collecting information on accidents, Tewari said. In 2018, Goa reported nine accidents due to drunk driving and four deaths.

Often, traffic police do not have the necessary equipment to determine the cause of an accident. For instance, most police report a case of drunk driving only through smelling, since most of them do not have a breathalyzer, especially in smaller cities, said Patanjali Dev Nayyar, the regional advisor for disability, injury prevention and rehabilitation at WHO.

‚ÄúIf the police arrive late at the scene of the accident, it is difficult to determine whether alcohol was involved,‚Äù Daniel Keniston, an assistant professor at Yale University, told IndiaSpend in July 2017.

415,"KKR Road to IPL 2021 Final: Undeterred by injuries, Kolkata make incredible turnaround in UAE","Image Source : IPLT20.COM KKR Road to IPL 2021 Final: Undeterred with injuries, Kolkata make incredible turnaround in UAE

Ahead of the resumption of the 2021 Indian Premier League (IPL 2021) in the United Arab Emirates, the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) were in disarray. With only two wins in seven matches, the KKR were reeling at seventh position in the table. Mumbai Indians, the side fourth in the table then, had eight points in seven matches. With a poor Net Run Rate (NRR) of -0.494, the Knight Riders were closer to the bottom of the table than the top-4.

On October 8, however, the KKR secured the fourth and final berth of the playoff stage with Rohit Sharma's MI failing to catch up with Eoin Morgan's side due to an inferior NRR.

In their remaining seven games of the season, the Knight Riders scored 10 points for an incredible turnaround. The side which had been struggling with inconsistent performances ever since its last IPL triumph in 2014 will now take on MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings in a bid to match their title count.

We take a look at the factors which led to this remarkable comeback.

A breath of fresh 'Iyer'

Image Source : IPLT20.COM Venkatesh Iyer.

Iyer has been the find of this season -- not only for the Knight Riders. As it turned out, Team India also roped in Iyer as net bowler ahead of the 2021 T20 World Cup, scheduled to take place in the UAE and Oman from Sunday.

The 26-year-old turned heads with consistent outings for the KKR with both, bat and ball.

After the Knight Riders failed to reap rewards with the decision to play Andre Russell primarily as a batter in the Indian leg of the tournament, the team management decided to do away with an extra bowler and replace Shivam Mavi with an opener who could also be called upon for a couple of overs. This allowed KKR to also utilize Russell's bowling skills.

Most runs in UAE leg so far

Player Matches (in UAE leg of IPL 2021) Runs Ruturaj Gaikwad (CSK) 8 407 Venkatesh Iyer (KKR) 9 320 KL Rahul (PBKS) 6 295

Against the Royal Challengers Bangalore, Andre Russell breathed fire as he returned figures of 3/9 in three overs, while Iyer remained unbeaten on 41 to secure a dominant nine-wicket victory for the side.

Iyer is currently the second-highest scorer in the UAE leg of the season (320 runs in 9 matches at a strike rate of 125).

As the season entered the business end of the league stage, the 26-year-old also contributed with the ball, ending with figures of 2/29 against Delhi Capitals in a win that effectively sealed a top-4 spot for KKR.

Undeterred by key injuries

Image Source : IPLT20.COM Andre Russell (L) and Lockie Ferguson missed a number of league games for the KKR in the UAE leg.

During the side's loss against Chennai Super Kings in its third game of the UAE leg, KKR faced a setback as their flamboyant all-rounder Andre Russell suffered a grade 2 hamstring injury. The side called upon Tim Southee as a replacement, who eventually filled in for Lockie Ferguson, after his fellow Kiwi teammate was ruled out with injury as well.

Even as Eoin Morgan struggled to put runs on the board, seasoned campaigners like Dinesh Karthik and Sunil Narine stepped up for the side in absence of their star players. While Karthik played cameo roles in the lower-middle order for the side, the West Indian Narine played the role of a finisher, slamming 50 runs in five innings at a strike rate of 166.66, including two unbeaten knocks. With the ball, Narine enjoyed a stellar run, picking up 11 wickets in the UAE leg with an impressive economy rate of 6.19.

Narine's stats in UAE leg:

Matches Run Scored S/R Wickets Taken Economy Rate Bowling Average 9 50 (in five innings) 166.66 11 6.19 20.27

A significant contribution from Narine came in the eliminator stage of the season when he scored 26 off just 15 deliveries to take KKR to a three-wicket victory in a low-scoring run-chase.

Varun Chakravarthy, meanwhile, remained consistent throughout the UAE leg, bowling at an incredible economy rate of 5.30 for his 11 wickets in nine matches.

Towards the business end of the league stage, the side also drafted in Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan for his all-round abilities. ""Shakib is always in the mix when you talk about selection. His skills set with left-arm bowling and batting, we consider him as top 3 batters but definitely, he can fit in the middle order somewhere,"" McCullum had said about the Bangladesh all-rounder ahead of the side's game against Sunrisers Hyderabad on October 3.

Shakib did return to the side and bowled an economical spell, registering figures of 1/20 in four overs. He has since played in all of KKR's games so far.","Image Source : IPLT20.COM KKR Road to IPL 2021 Final: Undeterred with injuries, Kolkata make incredible turnaround in UAEAhead of the resumption of the 2021 Indian Premier League (IPL 2021) in the United Arab Emirates, the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) were in disarray.

Photos taken at Vanagaram toll plaza (above) and Anakaputhur ‚Äî separate points across the 32-km bypass road ‚Äî show how dangerous the stretch becomes when darkness descends

CHENNAI: Accidents are on the rise on national highways in the city suburbs as streetlights have gone on the blink on many stretches. Chennai Bypass Road (NH-32), which connects Tambaram with Maduravoyal, does not have streetlights 13 years after the 32kmstretch was laid.Chennai Bypass Road was one of the 57 stretches selected by the Union ministry for road transport and highways to be developed as 'model national highways'. These stretches were supposed to have all safety features as road markings, junctions and entry/exit points.But none of this seems to be in place, and the number of accidents continues to increase. Around 30 accidents were reported on this highway every year; almost 40% of them happened between 6pm and 6am, says official data.Those who use the road have horror tales to tell. The service roads are incomplete on one side. Vehicles coming from Maduravoyal are unable to use the bridge because of this,"" said S Yuvaraj of Tamil Nadu Lorry Owners' Association.Officials said lighting was part of the approved project. ‚ÄúLighting was included in the cost estimate for development of Chennai Bypass Road as model stretch,‚Äù said S Janakumaran, project director with NHAI.""The cost estimate was submitted to the competent authority and approval for the same is awaited,"" he said in a written reply to a query under the Right to Information (RTI) Act on August 23.Every year, NHAI collects at least Rs 40 crore as user fee from the toll gate located on this stretch at Vanagaram. ‚ÄúBut NHAI is hesitant to spend on road development. The state government should take over this stretch as it has become more like an urban road used predominantly by Tambaram and Porur residents,‚Äù said Yuvraj.Similarly, on the Tambaram-Chengalpattu highway stretch, street lights have remained dysfunctional near Singaperumalkoil for months now. And the NHAI blames it on shortage of skilled labour owing to the pandemic.Road users have also complained about stretches of the Chennai-Bengaluru highway, where road expansion work is underway, being illlit. This makes motoring doubly dangerous. ‚ÄúIn the absence proper lighting on the road, headlamps of oncoming vehicles blind drivers.

Also, the decrease in the number of road accidents could be attributed to limited traffic movement due to COVID restrictions.

Transport minister Nitin Gadkari added that his ministry has put together a multi-pronged strategy to address the issue of road safety based on four factors - Education, Engineering of both roads and vehicles, Enforcement and Emergency Care.

Elaborating on the total number of accidents that took place in the year 2019, Gadkari said that the figures have declined by 4 per cent to 4,49,002. Of these, overspeeding caused 3,19,028 mishaps while drunken driving/consumption of alcohol and drugs caused 12,256. The number of accidents due to driving on the wrong side/ lane indiscipline, jumping red light and use of mobile phones in 2019 stood at 24,431; 4,443 and 10,522, respectively.

Roads need immediate attention

Even this year, numerous accidents took place on Indian roads during the monsoon season. Sinkholes became a daily news item in the national capital once the rains hit.

But apart from temporary fixtures, not much has been done to prevent such occurrences every season.

In 2019, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal launched a mega exercise to free 1260 kms of roads managed by its Public Works Department (PWD) from potholes.

418,Bihar first state to simplify road accident claims,"Bihar will be the first state to simplify claims of road traffic accident (RTA) by removing the victim or their dependents from the litigation process and paying them an interim ex-gratia amount of ‚Çπ5 lakh within 15 days in event of death, officials driving the change have said.

The state will also take the onus to contest the case in court, on behalf of the victim, if the insurance firm of the accused vehicle owner, decides to challenge the order.

Come September 15, and the state will implement the new amendment to the Bihar Motor Vehicle Rules that empowers the state transport appellate tribunal to settle all such accident claims within 60 days. The new amendment was notified in the Bihar gazette on August 11 after a cabinet order.

So far, road traffic accident claims are tried in the civil court and linger for years.

‚ÄúThis is the first of its kind initiative in India to simplify accident claims,‚Äù said Bihar‚Äôs transport secretary, Sanjay Kumar Agarwal.

The new rules allow immediate payment of ‚Çπ5 lakh as interim compensation for death and ‚Çπ50,000 for grievous injury to dependents or victims of road traffic accidents, involving vehicles that are insured, uninsured or involved in hit-and-run case. The compensation for grievous injury is proposed to be increased from ‚Çπ50,000 to ‚Çπ2.5 lakh.

As part of the new rules, victims or their relatives will not have to run from pillar to post for settlement of claim. The state will pay the interim compensation and also take the responsibility of fighting a legal suit on behalf of the victim if an insurance firm were to challenge its order.

‚ÄúWe have set up a revolving corpus of ‚Çπ50 crore under the Bihar motor vehicle accident assistance fund through which such payments will be made,‚Äù said Agarwal.

In case of insured vehicles, the state will pay the compensation to the victim or their dependents through the corpus fund and recover the amount from the insurance firm after the tribunal settles the case within the stipulated 60 days, he added.

For uninsured vehicles, the state will recover the compensation amount by auctioning the vehicle if its vehicle owner is unable to pay the compensation to the victim‚Äôs family. Should the amount realised through auction be less than the compensation fixed, the state will bear the difference amount through the Bihar motor vehicle accident assistance fund, said Agarwal.

Nearly 20% of the 13.60 lakh registered vehicles in the state till 2019-20 do not renew their insurance. ‚ÄúWe will start a special drive to check for insurance of motor vehicles soon,‚Äù he added.

For hit-and-run case, the compensation amount will be borne through the corpus fund and replenished partially by the Centre through insurance companies, which pay ‚Çπ50,000. The state will bear the remaining ‚Çπ4,50,000 in deaths involving hit-and-run cases.

Under the changed rules, all sub-divisional officers (SDO) will be the accident claim inquiry officer and district magistrates (DM) the accident claims assessment officer. The SDO conducts the inquiry on the basis of site inspection done by the police and the motor vehicle inspector.

‚ÄúThe changed rules do not mandate any site inspection or examination of witness at the trial stage. If challenged, the case will be adjudicated on the basis of a summary trial based on the petition of the victim or their relatives, deposition by the insurance firm and reports by the police, the SDO and DM,‚Äù said Agarwal.

In case the tribunal or a higher court awards a higher compensation, the difference of the amount already paid as interim compensation would be credited into the bank account of the victim‚Äôs family. However, in case of an adverse order for the government, the interim amount already paid as compensation to the family of the victim will not be taken back but adjusted through the Bihar motor vehicle accident assistance fund.

Bihar ranks 15th in India in terms of road accidents and ninth in terms of fatalities arising out of them, as per the latest data released by the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRT&H) in 2019.

Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat are among states which rank higher than Bihar both in terms of number of road accidents and deaths.

Bihar had only 9.3 recorded cases of road accidents against the national average of 34.2 per lakh population in 2019.

With a score of 11.7, it ranked 22nd in terms of accidents per 10,000 vehicles.","Come September 15, and the state will implement the new amendment to the Bihar Motor Vehicle Rules that empowers the state transport appellate tribunal to settle all such accident claims within 60 days.

Indian Orthopedic Association, which observed Bone and Joint Day on Wednesday, said that the link between proper first aid and basic life support immediately after an accident is missing and it is providing training to students, police personnel and other citizens to help them become life saviours.

‚ÄúMost of the deaths (due to accidents) occur due to lack of first medical care in the first golden hour after the accident. Many of these lives can be saved by providing proper first-aid immediately after an accident which can very well be provided by any common man or police personnel if they are trained for this,‚Äù Indian Orthopedic Association said in a release.

""This link of proper first aid and basic life support immediately after an accident is missing. Indian Orthopedic Association targets to provide training to one lakh students, police personnel and common man from August 1 to August 7 to make them life saviours, "" it said

With just one per cent of the world's vehicles, India accounts for 11 per cent of the global deaths in road accidents, the highest in the world, according to a report by the World Bank.

420,Three dead as incessant rains lash Uttarakhand; Chardham yatra halted temporarily,"Three labourers from Nepal died and two more were injured as incessant rains lashed Uttarakhand for the second consecutive day on Monday, prompting the authorities to advise Chardham pilgrims not to proceed to the Himalayan temples till the weather improves.

The labourers were staying in a tent at Samkhal near Lansdowne in Pauri district when rubble flowing down from a field above due to the rains buried them alive, District Magistrate Vijay Kumar Jogdande said.

They had been engaged in a hotel construction work in the area. The injured were admitted to the Kotdwar base hospital, he said.

Meanwhile, Chardham pilgrims who arrived in Haridwar and Rishikesh by Sunday have been asked not to proceed further till the weather improves, while operation of vehicles for the Himalayan temples has been suspended temporarily.

Passenger vehicles are not being allowed to cross the Chandrabhaga bridge, Tapovan, Lakshman Jhoola and Muni-ki-Reti Bhadrakali barriers in Rishikesh.

Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami visited the state disaster control room at the secretariat here to take weather updates and know the conditions of roads and highways.

He appealed to the pilgrims to defer their journey for two days until the weather normalises. They are staying in safe locations spread across Haridwar, Rishikesh, Shrinagar, Tehri, Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Guptkashi, Ukhimath, Karnaprayag, Joshimath and Pandukeshwar.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah spoke to Dhami on the phone to get an update on precautionary steps being taken by the state government in view of the heavy rain alert and assured him of all possible help.

It has been raining in Kedarnath since Sunday night but the Mandakini river is flowing at its normal level. A Devasthanam Board official said regular prayers at the four Himalayan temples are continuing and pilgrims staying there are safe.

Pilgrims headed for Yamunotri have been asked to stay in Badkot and Jankichatti, whereas those en route to Gangotri have been asked to stay in Harsil, Bhatwari and Maneri, Uttarkashi District Magistrate Mayur Dikshit told PTI.

Kedarnath and Badrinath-bound pilgrims have also been requested not to proceed on their journey till the weather clears. Most of the pilgrims on way to Badrinath are staying in Joshimath and Chamoli, Chamoli district disaster management officer N K Joshi said.

Around 4,000 yatris out of a total of 6,000 in Kedarnath on Sunday have returned while the rest are lodged in safe locations.

Many of them have been stopped in Linchauli and Bhimbali as a precautionary measure, Rudraprayag disaster management officer N S Singh said.

The Chardham Devasthanam Board said the yatra has been temporarily halted for the sake of safety of pilgrims in view of the heavy rain alert issued by the Uttarakhand meteorological department for October 17-19.

The peaks beyond Badrinath and Kedarnath received light snowfall, whereas the lower areas in Chamoli district were lashed by continuous showers. Rain continued in Uttarkashi and Dehradun as well.

Dhami has asked the district administrations to provide hourly updates on the weather and the condition of roads. He also asked them to keep a minimum response time in case of a disaster.

Most educational institutions across Uttarakhand remained closed on Monday, while a ban was imposed on trekking, mountaineering and camping activities in the high altitude areas of the state, including the Nanda Devi biosphere reserve and various forest divisions, till Tuesday as a precautionary measure.

The district-level Khel Mahakumbh events to be held at parade and pavilion grounds in Dehradun on October 18-19 have been cancelled. They have now been rescheduled for October 24 and 25.

Heavy to very heavy rains, lightning, hail storms and high speed winds (60-70 kmph) have been predicted by the Met department for all 13 districts of Uttarakhand between October 17 and 19.

421,"With Single Data Source, India Tends To Underreport Road Crash Deaths","Mumbai and Noida: India banks solely on police data for estimating deaths in road accidents, ignoring other critical sources, leading to a data gap that impairs its emergency response system, makes it difficult to design and implement accident prevention strategies, and leads to an underestimation of accidental deaths, experts say.



The World Health Organization (WHO) classified India's official data on road traffic fatalities as ""unusable"" or ""unavailable"" because of ""quality issues"" in its 2019 Global Health Estimates released in December 2020. This study is still the latest available source of global data on death and disability by region, country, age, sex and cause.

In its methods and country-level data sources handbook , the WHO pointed out that it has official figures from India for only 2001-2003 and 2010-2013. For the remaining years, it has had to collate numbers from the Global Burden of Diseases (2019) study produced by its partnering institute, the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) , an independent research center at the University of Washington, said a WHO statistician who did not wish to be named.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways ( MoRTH )'s data on road crash deaths are not complete because the data reporting process of the police departments is flawed, there is significant underreporting especially in rural India, and not enough public trust in the police, experts told IndiaSpend.

The WHO classifies all countries into four categories on the basis of data availability on the cause of death: ""high completeness"", ""low completeness and/or issues with cause-of-death assignment"", ""low completeness with severe quality issues"" and ""data are unavailable"".

In the case of road deaths, for example, Japan is listed in the ""high completeness"" category and Thailand in ""low completeness"", while India's numbers are categorised as ""data are unavailable"". While Japan collates road deaths data from sources such as hospitals, ambulance services, forensic investigation of crash sites and insurance providers, Thailand banks on its ministries of public health, interior and transport and so on for estimates.

However, this gap is normal because the WHO and the Indian government use different methods to collect numbers and it is difficult to prove which method is more robust, Anshuman Mohanty, economic advisor, Transport Research Wing, MoRTH, told IndiaSpend.

A comprehensive crash investigation system is required to offer every stakeholder--the public, the police and policy makers--strong evidence on the contributing factors, wrote Benedicta Isaac-Kumar, a consultant with Chennai-based Citizen consumer and civic Action Group , a non-profit, voluntary and professional citizens group.

Why police data are incomplete

In India, there are two reports on data relating to road traffic accidents--the 'Road Accidents in India' report of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and the 'Crime in India' report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) . As in many countries, the data are sourced entirely from the police departments of states and union territories.

Here is how the police collect crash information. Once they are informed about a road accident by someone involved in the mishap, a witness or a police officer at the site, a First Information Report (FIR) is recorded.Its content can only be changed with the permission of the High Court or the Supreme Court of India, explains a 2020 Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT-Delhi) study . Once the investigation concludes, a case file is prepared. After this, the offending party is charged under provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Motor Vehicles Act of India 1988.

In the case of serious injuries and instantaneous death, the survivor or the victim's family may file an FIR only if they want to pursue the case in a court or claim compensation, insurance after adjudication by the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal .

The IIT study also reported that most cases are attributed to ""human error"" and this means that factors such as vehicular and infrastructural problems are not included. The cause of the crash has to be recorded as the ""fault"" of a ""road user"" as per the India Penal Code (IPC) and Motor Vehicle Act 1988, ignoring all other factors.

On the shortcomings of the data reporting mechanism in India, the MoRTH report itself pointed out that if a road accident victim dies in a hospital after 30 days of the accident, it is not reported as a road traffic fatality.

""Collecting data from different sources to build meaningful analysis of road crashes is vital,"" said Piyush Tewari, founder of the New Delhi-based SaveLIFE Foundation (SLF), an independent non-profit organisation focussed on improving road safety and emergency medical care. ""For example, data can be collected from police officials, ambulance service providers, information from bystanders etc.""

""We don't have any national trauma registry database where hospitals need to report road accident deaths or injuries, like now all hospitals need to report Covid-19 cases on a central portal,"" M.C. Misra, the former director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), told IndiaSpend.

Underreporting of deaths

Due to the inadequate police presence in India's rural areas, it is possible that about 50% of road crash deaths there go unreported, said the IIT study. For urban pockets, this figure is lower but still significant, 10-20%. In urban areas, most of the road accident deaths and injuries get reported which occur in a hospital. Due to the sparse density of hospitals in rural areas, the chances of missing accidents, deaths and injuries are higher.

Data on non-fatal crash injuries in India may also be unreliable because survivors may choose not to report them to the police or hospitals, the IIT Delhi study noted.

Lack of trust, bias

Road traffic accidents and injuries go unreported because of entrenched biases among both the police and civilians. Accident survivors in India are reluctant to report cases because they believe the police to be apathetic and also because they do not want to be caught up in lengthy police procedures, especially in rural areas, said G. Gururaj , former director of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences ( NIMHANS ). He pointed to the fact that in rural areas, an accident victim is first cremated and then the case reported to the police.

When accidents occur, police officials tend to assume that drivers of large vehicles such as truck drivers are at fault, ignoring the conditions of the vehicle, fatigue among drivers, road conditions, and so on, said Tewari of SLF, adding that this is why truck drivers tend not to report accidents. About 40% of respondents in the 2020 SLF survey on truck drivers said they were dissatisfied with their jobs because of harassment from the police, the transport authorities and local residents.

Skewed distribution of traffic resources

Police departments are also stretched for human and other resources. About 27% of the vacancies in traffic police departments across India have yet to be filled, according to the 2020 Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) report on 'Data on Police Organizations'. Eight states--Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat, Telangana, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar--have more than 40% of posts waiting to be filled in their traffic police forces. Among them, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Gujarat appear in the top 10 list of most number of road accidents in India in 2019, per MoRTH report .","Why police data are incompleteIn India, there are two reports on data relating to road traffic accidents--the 'Road Accidents in India' report of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and the 'Crime in India' report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) .

423,"Centres newest way to address road fatalities, cash rewards for Good Samaritans","From signing the Brasilia Declaration to the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act, 2019, the government has taken up several measures to reduce road mishaps

Being a Good Samaritan pays! At least, it will now.

As per a recent notification by the road ministry, anyone who saves the life of a road accident victim by rushing them to a hospital within the ‚Äògolden hour‚Äô will be rewarded Rs 5,000 for their effort.

The Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has issued guidelines for the scheme, which will be in place from 15 October 2021 till 31 March, 2026.

MoRTH has announced award scheme of Rs. 5,000 to Good Samaritan, w.e.f. 15 October. https://t.co/FQxpKndOwS pic.twitter.com/YfNQCHTOyI ‚Äî MORTHINDIA (@MORTHIndia) October 6, 2021

The government has been implementing several plans to make the country‚Äôs roads safe for travelling.

Road accidents in India

A report, titled Guide for Road Safety Opportunities and Challenges: Low- and Middle-Income Countries Country Profiles, by the World Bank revealed that with only one percent of the world's vehicles, India accounted for 11 percent of the global death in road accidents, the highest in the world in 2019.

Data showed that the country accounts for about 4.5 lakh road crashes per annum, in which 1.5 lakh people die. The report further stated that India witnessed 53 road crashes every hour; killing one person every four minutes.

The road ministry also stated that 76.2 percent of people who died in road crashes are in the age group of 18-45 years.

The situation is so dire in the nation that Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Nitin Gakdari had been quoted as saying that the road accident scenario in India was more ""dangerous than the COVID-19 pandemic"".

A recent study commissioned by MoRTH estimated the socio-economic costs of road crashes at Rs 1,47,114 crore in India, which is equivalent to 0.77 percent of the country's GDP.

Brasilia Declaration on Road Safety

Taking into consideration the high number of deaths on roads across the globe, in 2015, the World Health Organisation came up with the Brasilia Declaration, which called out for stringent traffic laws to prevent accidents.

In the declaration, participating countries asserted their commitment to reducing the deaths caused due to traffic accidents to half by the year 2020. This target was set under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. India adopted the same in 2015, with Nitin Gadkari signing it on behalf of India at the 2nd High Level Global Conference.

However, India hasn't been able to achieve the goal of cutting road death rates by 50 percent. Gadkari said that a total of 366,138 road accidents occurred in India during the calendar year 2020, a drop from the 4,37,396 road accident cases in 2019.

Similarly deaths have also reduced with India reporting 1,31,714 deaths in 2020 compared to 1,54,732 in 2019.

Motor Vehicles Amendment Act, 2019

Another way the government has tried to reduce road deaths is by implementing the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act, 2019.

The legislation increased the penalties for traffic violations, defective vehicles and juvenile driving.

It also provides for a Motor Vehicle Accident Fund, which would provide compulsory insurance cover to all road users in India for certain types of accidents.

When introduced in September 2019, many had criticised it saying that the amendment to the law was solely done to earn money from traffic violations. However, defending the move, Nitin Gadkari had reiterated that the idea of increasing the penalty against the violators was not to earn money but to save the life of many stakeholders who could be involved in road traffic accidents.

In fact, Nitin Gadkari told the Lok Sabha in November 2019 that road accidents and fatalities reduced nine percent in at least nine states after the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 came into effect from 1 September 2019.

During September-October 2019, 3,375 people died in road accidents in comparison to 3,729 deaths during the same period in 2018.

Moreover, the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 had also inserted a new section 134A for the protection of good Samaritans who come to the aid of road accident victims.

The rules provided for the Rights of Good Samaritan, which include that the person shall be treated respectfully without any discrimination on the grounds of religion, nationality, caste or sex.

The rule also stated that every public and private hospital shall publish a charter in Hindi, English and vernacular language, at the entrance or other conspicuous location and on their website, stating the rights of good Samaritans under the Act and the rules made thereunder.

And on 5 October, the government said that a good Samaritan would be given a cash award of Rs 5,000 if he rushed a road accident victim to the hospital within the 'golden hour' of the mishap.

For those who don't know, the 'Golden hour' refers to the one-hour time period following a traumatic injury during which there is the highest likelihood of preventing death by providing prompt medical care.

Better roads

Other than the new legislation, the government has also acknowledged the role that the quality of roads play in accidents.

As one can imagine, faulty roads are accident-prone and curves on roads and potholes are contributing factors to road accidents.

The Road Accidents in India 2018 report by MoRTH showed that roads with sharp curves, potholes and steep gradients tend to be more accident-prone because successfully negotiating them requires skill, extra care and alertness.

Additionally, speeding on highways is another reason for accidents.

KK Kapila, President Emeritus of International Road Federation was quoted as telling Deccan Herald, ""Accidents are caused due to the tendency to over-speed on the good quality of Expressways and Highways wherein the safety parameters are often compromised to reduce costs.""

Road discipline

Road discipline is one thing that is lacking among drivers, which leads to accidents and fatalities.

Drivers and two-wheeler users often are found not wearing seatbelts and helmets respectively.

For this, the government has carried out several public service announcements, emphasising the importance of both and also imposed heavy fines for those who don't comply.

Nitin Gadkari hopes that reduction deaths in road accidents to go down by 50 percent before 2025. He had also said that if ""we keep waiting till 2030, then at least six-seven lakh people will die more due to road accidents"".

Will we be able to achieve this goal? Let's hope so!

425,Sobering effect: On drunk driving and awareness,"Anjani Chadha By

Express News Service

""I still feel a rush of fear down my spine every time I am in the front seat of a speeding car,"" shares Mahek* (21) as she recounts a road accident that she survived when she was six years old. Now a psychology graduate from Delhi University, Mahek* was in the front seat of her car when the driver, who was under the influence of alcohol, rammed their hatchback into a road divider.

Fifteen years later and despite a set of strict laws and regulations, drunk driving is one of the major reasons behind road accidents in India. According to the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, in 2019 there were 12,256 road accidents related to drunk driving. Over the last few years, the government has enforced stringent laws to address this issue. However, little has changed.

A number of citizen-led campaigns and advocacy groups have taken centre stage to combat the issue of driving under the influence, at a community level. Community Against Drunken Driving (CADD), a non-profit organisation in South Delhi, has extensively addressed this issue through advocacy and community involvement.

It's an attitude problem

Prince Singhal, a road safety expert and founder of CADD, mentions that drunk driving is an ""attitudinal problem"" and requires mindset change in order to be solved permanently. The September 2019 amendment of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988 mentions that in the case of drunken driving, first-time offenders will face imprisonment up to six months and/or fine up to Rs 10,000. The second offence, if within two years, can lead to up to two years prison term and/or fine of Rs 15,000.

Over the last two decades, a number of campaigns have been enforced by the government as well as civil society groups to tackle the issue of drunk driving. CADD has launched more than 1,200 awareness campaigns across the country by adopting a multi-sectoral approach to educate and safeguard communities from drunk-driving fatalities.

""The attitude of people is extremely callous when it comes to driving on the roads. The chalta hai [it should be okay] attitude needs to be governed through tighter laws and public movements,"" says Singhal.

A menace to tackle

""The youth is the most vulnerable age group when it comes to drinking and driving,"" Singhal points out, hinting at the increasing glamorisation of alcohol. There has also been an increase in cases of underage drinking across the country.

The minimum legal drinking age varies from state to state (it was lowered from 25 to 21 in Delhi earlier this year). A research conducted by CADD in 2018, however, revealed that nearly 62 per cent of the interviewed youth in the 14 to 21 age group, routinely consumed alcohol.

The survey further suggests that there are negligible checks on underage drinking, which leads to higher cases of drinking and driving among the youth.

427,India loses 1.5 lakh lives due to road accidents every year; here is how most of them can be saved,"While India accounts for about 1% of motor vehicles globally, it records more than 11% of road traffic deaths

Every year, the lives of 1.3 million people are cut short due to road accidents. In India itself, around 150,000 people lose their lives on roads every year. While India accounts for about 1 percent of motor vehicles globally, it records more than 11 percent of road traffic deaths.

In the past few years, countries like Sweden, Australia and the United Kingdom have improved their road safety outcomes through effective central legislation. India too enacted the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act, 2019. It was the result of a five-year effort to improve national legislation on road safety. The enactment of the new legislation is a positive step; however, even after two years, the situation on the ground has not improved much.

While implementation of the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act 2019 needs to be done on a priority basis, this article highlights three additional steps to be undertaken to improve road safety in our country.

Adopting the safe system approach

Traditionally, road safety interventions have revolved around modifying human behaviour to prevent road crashes. However, the safe system approach hinges on the principle that human beings will make mistakes, and the risk of these mistakes should not result in a fatality or a serious injury.

Today, city agencies are more concerned with moving motor vehicles as quickly as possible, even at the cost of risking the lives of pedestrians and cyclists. About 90 percentof the pedestrian deaths recorded in Gurugram in 2020 occurred on national highways, state highways or expressways, all high-speed corridors.

It is essential that speed along these corridors, especially at the intersection, needs to be brought down to a safe limit, which can be accomplished with a good design. However, any efforts to increase speed will only lead to an increase in traffic crashes, especially those involving vulnerable road users.

Importance of ‚Äòsafer‚Äô infrastructure

Traditionally, the 5Es of road safety involves ‚Äî Education, Encouragement, Enforcement, Evaluation, and Engineering. Most often, education is the first E, and the last E is engineering.

Yes, road safety education is essential, but empirical studies from around the world have shown that ‚Äòeducation‚Äô alone does not improve road safety. What is needed is safe infrastructure and safe vehicles, in addition to road users, who follow safety rules.

However, ‚Äòroad safety‚Äô dialogues in India still do not highlight the importance of safer roads.

The starting point of creating safer roads is by collecting data on road traffic crashes and geocoding the location of these crashes. The analysis of this data will help identify high-risk roads and sites, also called ‚Äúblackspots‚Äù and improving the infrastructure of these locations will improve overall safety. Also, road safety audits and inspection of existing and new roads will ensure a gradual decrease in ‚Äúblackspots‚Äù.

Managing speeds

Managing speed to improve safety does not come naturally to us. That is because we have still not understood the impact of speed, especially in areas where highways and other high-speed corridors interact with pedestrians and slow-moving traffic.

For example, if a pedestrian is hit by a car at 30 kmph, their chance of survival is 90 percent. However, if the same collision occurs at 50 kmph, which is the legal speed limit, the likelihood is only 15 percent.

India is a signatory to the Stockholm Declaration of 2020. The biggest and the boldest recommendation from the Stockholm Declaration is on speed. The declaration asks members to mandate a maximum travel speed of 30 km/h in areas where non-motorised road users and motor vehicles mix frequently. It means that the streets inside the city need to be designed and enforced for a maximum speed of 30 km/h or less. Reducing speed, in general, also has a positive impact on air quality and climate change and reduces road traffic deaths and injuries.

Road traffic crashes are an epidemic in India. It is not only a public health issue but an economic one. The country loses $58 billion, or 3 percent of its GDP, every year due to road traffic crashes. The COVID-19 crisis did halt the mobility, but things are improving, and the country is moving towards a post-Covid scenario.

Therefore, it needs to build back better, which would be impossible without addressing the critical issue of road safety. After all, the benefits of improving road safety go far beyond increasing the overall quality of life for India‚Äôs citizens and will undoubtedly save many lives.

429,1.2 lakh people died in road accidents in 2020: NCRB,"India saw 1.35 lakh cases of hit-and-run since 2018, the data show.

India recorded 1.2 lakh cases of ‚Äúdeaths due to negligence relating to road accidents‚Äù in 2020, with 328 persons losing their lives every day on an average, despite the COVID-19 lockdown, according to government data.

As many as 3.92 lakh lives have been lost in three years in deaths due to negligence related to road accidents, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) revealed in its annual ‚ÄòCrime India‚Äô report for 2020. While 1.2 lakh deaths were recorded in 2020, the figures stood at 1.36 lakh in 2019 and 1.35 lakh in 2018, the data show.

The country logged 1.35 lakh cases of ‚Äúhit and run‚Äù since 2018, the report of the NCRB, which functions under the Union Home Ministry, showed. In 2020 alone, there were 41,196 cases of ‚Äúhit and run‚Äù, while there were 47,504 such cases in 2019 and 47,028 in 2018, the report said. On an average, there were 112 cases of ‚Äúhit and run‚Äù reported across the country every day in the past year, according to the data. The cases of causing ‚Äúhurt‚Äù by rash or negligent driving on public way stood at 1.30 lakh in 2020.

Rail accidents

Meanwhile, 52 cases of deaths due to negligence related to rail accidents were recorded across the country in 2020; 55 such cases in 2019 and 35 in 2018, the report showed.

During 2020, India also logged 133 cases of ‚Äúdeaths due to medical negligence;‚Äù 201 such cases in 2019 and 218 in 2018, the NCRB said. There were 51 cases of ‚Äúdeaths due to negligence of civic bodies‚Äù in 2020, while there were 147 cases in 2019 and 40 in 2018, according to the report.

Another 6,367 cases of ‚Äúdeaths due to other negligence‚Äù were reported across the country in 2020; 7,912 cases in 2019 and 8,687 in 2018, it showed.

The NCRB stated in the report that the country remained under complete lockdown from March 25, 2020 till May 31, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the movement in public space was ‚Äúvery limited‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe cases registered under crimes against women, children and senior citizens, theft, burglary, robbery and dacoity have therefore declined, whereas COVID-related enforcement has resulted in increase of cases registered under ‚Äòdisobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant [Section 188 IPC]‚Äô, under ‚ÄòOther IPC Crimes‚Äô and under ‚ÄòOther State Local Acts‚Äô,‚Äù it noted.","India saw 1.35 lakh cases of hit-and-run since 2018, the data show.

‚ÄúThe amount of award for each Good Samaritan would be Rs. 5,000 per incident. Every cash award would be accompanied with a certification of appreciation,"" it said. Golden hour is the one hour period after a traumatic injury and there is the highest likelihood of preventing death by providing prompt medical care to the victim.

Rules for Good Samaritans was notified by the ministry on September 29, 2020, as per the provisions under Section 134A of the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act, 2019. ""Now, it has been felt that there is a need to motivate the general public through cash awards and certificates to help the road accident victims in an emergency situation and to boost their morale, and also to inspire and motivate others to save lives of the road accident victims,"" the ministry said.

According to the ministry‚Äôs guidelines, an individual Good Samaritan can be awarded a maximum of five times a year. The ministry also said there will be 10 national-level awards for the most worthy Good Samaritans, who will be selected from all those who have been awarded during an entire year, and they would be given an award of ‚Çπ100,000 each. Under the guidelines, if more than one Good Samaritan saves the life of more than one victim, the amount of award will be ‚Çπ5,000 for every person saved, subject to a maximum of ‚Çπ5,000 per Good Samaritan. The ministry said it will provide ‚Çπ5 lakh as an initial grant to the transport department of states and Union territories for rewarding the Good Samaritans.

The guidelines say that in case the Good Samaritan informs the police about the accident, the police will provide an acknowledgement to the person after verifying details from a doctor on an official letter pad. The copy of the acknowledgement would then be sent to the appraisal committee formed at the district level under the chairmanship of the district magistrate by the concerned police station. And, a copy will be marked to the Good Samaritan. If the Good Samaritan takes the road accident victim to the hospital directly, the hospital will provide all the details to the concerned police station. The police shall provide an acknowledgement to such Good Samaritan, it added.

Last month, the Rajasthan government announced a similar reward for Good Samaritans who save lives by taking road accident victims to hospitals. It said that the ‚Çπ5,000 cash reward will be given under the Mukhyamantri Chiranjeevi Jeevan Rakshak Yojna. The person will also be given a certificate, it added.

431,"Centre to roll out Rs 7,270 crore scheme for road safety in 14 states","State Support Programme for Strengthening Road Safety will be implemented in 14 states that make up 85 per cent of the total road fatalities in the country. (Reuters photo)

The Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) is all set to roll out a new Rs 7,270 crore State Support Programme for Strengthening Road Safety to help realise the vision of ‚ÄúZero road fatalities on Indian roads.‚Äù

The centrally-sponsored six-year programme will be implemented in 14 states that are now contributing to 85 per cent of the total road fatalities in the country.

While MoRTH will lend a budgetary support of Rs 3,635 crore, an amount of Rs 1,818 crore will be secured as loan each from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

Of the total cost, Rs 6,725 crore will be disbursed to the 14 states based on their performance while MoRTH will use Rs 545 crore for capacity building activities.

The scheme will incentivise state governments to drive road safety interventions at the grassroots level with the main objective of curbing road accidents and achieving a reduction in fatalities, the MoRTH said in a concept note circulated to the target states.

The target states under the scheme are Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Bihar, Telangana, West Bengal, Odisha, Haryana and Assam.

""This is an output and outcome-driven scheme wherein the performance of the states will be assessed on 11 mandatory and three elective indicators (road safety interventions). The grants will be distributed to the states based on the Key Performance Indicators,"" top official sources told PTI.

The preliminary project report prepared by MoRTH says the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act (2019) was brought in as an important intervention to achieve the fatality reduction target.

""To leverage the strengthened law, it is necessary to have focused interventions in the related areas of road safety like road engineering, enforcement, road safety advocacy and media campaigns and efficient emergency response systems. The states need to be supported to act on result-oriented strategies. Hence the new scheme,"" the sources said.

India reported about 1.51 lakh road deaths in 4.49 lakh accidents in the year 2019. Of the total deaths, the 14 identified states accounted for 1,27,379.

The number of fatalities remained consistent over the last five years.

In 2020, 1.32 lakh road deaths were recorded across the country, with the Covid-19-induced lockdown resulting in the reduction in number.

The new scheme targets to reduce the fatality rate by 30 per cent by March 2027.

Cyclists, two and three-wheeler riders and pedestrians have been identified as ‚Äúvulnerable road users‚Äù who comprised about 54 per cent of road traffic deaths in India.

Under the new scheme, performance-based indicators have been proposed with the aim of reducing the impact of road accidents on these vulnerable users.

An Integrated Road Accident Database (IRAD) will be rolled out in all states by 2022-23 and applied for identifying and rectifying all black spots on state highways and major district roads.

Road safety audit will be made mandatory on state highways and urban roads by the end of the scheme period.

From 2022-23, MoRTH will launch a ‚ÄúChallenge Round‚Äù every year to provide incentives to states on additional road safety interventions and also to promote competition among states.

""The grant of Rs 7,270 crore will only meet partial fund requirement for the scheme. States are expected to make their own budgetary allocations and also implement projects in Public-Private Partnership mode,"" MoRTH told the states.

Independent Verification Agencies will scrutinise the states' achievements, based on which the Central grant will be released.

Some of the other major interventions mooted under the scheme are: Installation of speed management devices on urban roads in cities with a population of over four lakh, state highways and national highways for increased enforcement, a unique number for reporting accidents, development of dedicated lanes for two-wheelers on state highways and urban roads and identification of priority corridors.

State Education Boards will be required to introduce a chapter on road safety for classes 6-9 in 2022-23 and up to class-12 the next year on.

Deployment of Advance Traffic Management System, campaigns on vehicle safety and driver training, establishment of a Command and Control (Data) Centre for ambulances, establishment of automated vehicle fitness centres are some of the other initiatives planned under the scheme.","State Support Programme for Strengthening Road Safety will be implemented in 14 states that make up 85 per cent of the total road fatalities in the country.

432,"Jagran Explainer | Fixed driving hours, sleep detection sensor: Nitin Gadkari's proposed plan aims to reduce road accidents in India","New Delhi | Jagran News Desk: Road accidents are one of the common problems in India. With only 1 per cent of the world's vehicles, India accounts for 11 per cent of the global death in road accidents, the highest in the world, according to a report by the World Bank. Accidents by truck drivers constitute a large part of this logistics. Over-speeding, fatigue, and sleepiness are the major causes of road crashes by truck drivers in India.

In a bid to reduce road accidents and give relief to truck drivers, Union Minister for Road Transport Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday called for fixed driving hours for truck drivers. He also directed that trucks should be fixed with onboard sleep detection sensors at par with European standards to achieve this purpose.

Measures suggested by Gadkari to reduce road accidents:

Presiding over a meeting of the National Road Safety Council (NRSC), Gadkari said that just like pilots have fixed flying hours, drivers of commercial trucks - a segment of vehicles that forms a major part of highway traffic ‚Äì should have fixed driving hours, to reduce driving fatigue.

He also directed NRSC authorities that commercial vehicles should have onboard sleep detection sensors and sought timely updates on the matter after every two months.

""Have directed officers to work on a policy to include On-Board Sleep Detection Sensors in Commercial Vehicles, at par with European standards,"" Gadkari said in a tweet.

What is sleep detection sensor?

A sleep detection sensor is a car safety technology that helps to prevent accidents when the driver gets drowsy. It sets a sleep alarm in the vehicle for detecting the condition indicative of the onset of sleepiness. For example, an eye blink sensor is used to keep track of the driver‚Äôs eyelid motion. Similarly, a vibrating device is incorporated within the driver‚Äôs seat which gets activated when the conditions are not satisfied. Sleep detection sensors are widely used in European countries in vehicles, particularly commercial vehicles, to avoid road accidents. In India, the system is still not very popular.

Road accidents in India:

According to the World Bank report, India accounts for about 4.5 lakh road crashes per annum, of which 1.5 lakh people die. Every hour 53 road crashes occur; killing 1 person every 4 minutes. In the last decade, 13 lakh people died and another 50 lakh got injured on Indian roads.

A recent study commissioned by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) estimates the socio-economic costs of road crashes at Rs 1,47,114 crore in India, which is equivalent to 0.77 per cent of the country's GDP.

At the individual level, road crash injuries and deaths impose a severe financial burden and push entire (non-poor) households into poverty and the already poor into debt.

435,Good Samaritan scheme comes into force in Madhya Pradesh,"Under the ‚ÄúGood Samaritan Scheme,‚Äô any person who saves the life of a victim of a road accident by rushing him to a hospital or a trauma centre would be rewarded with ‚Çπ5,000.

A Central scheme aimed at bringing down the fatalities in road accidents by rewarding Good Samaritans who rush the victims to a hospital within the ‚Äúgolden hour‚Äù has come into force in Madhya Pradesh, a senior official said on Saturday.

Under the ‚ÄúGood Samaritan Scheme,‚Äô any person who saves the life of a victim of a road accident by rushing him to a hospital or a trauma centre would be rewarded with ‚Çπ5,000.

‚ÄúThe Centre‚Äôs Good Samaritan Scheme has come into effect on the day of Dussehra (October 15) in Madhya Pradesh‚Äô‚Äô, State Traffic and Road Safety Additional Director General of Police (ADG) G. Janardhan told PTI on Saturday.

He said the scheme was aimed at motivating the general public to help the victims of road accidents in emergencies and inspire and motivate others to save innocent lives.

In August, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways informed Parliament that a total of 3,66,138 road accidents occurred in India during the calendar year 2020, causing 1,31,714 deaths.

The ADG said a Good Samaritan is eligible for the cash prize in case the road accident victim sustains brain, spinal cord injuries or is admitted to the hospital for a minimum of three days or undergoes major surgery.

Janardhan, who is also ADG, M.P. Police Training and Research Institute (PTRI), said that each Good Samaritan would also receive a certificate of appreciation along with ‚Çπ5,000 in cash for saving the life of a road accident victim.

An individual could be awarded a maximum of five times in a year, he said.

The senior official stressed that the details provided by the person who saves the life of a road accident victim will be used for giving incentives and they won‚Äôt be used anywhere else.

Explaining the procedure, Janardhan said after a Good Samaritan rushes the victim to the hospital or trauma centre, the doctor concerned will inform the police. Police will write down the details of him in a format and forward it to that district appraisal committee, comprising collector, superintendent of police, chief medical and health officer and Regional Transport Officer (RTO) which will scrutinise the cases and clear the reward.

Asked about the golden hour, the senior police officer said, ‚Äú As per the Motor Vehicle Act‚Äôs Section 2 (12 A), it (golden hour) means the period lasting one hour following a traumatic injury during which there is the highest likelihood of preventing death by providing prompt medical care‚Äù.

In the event of two people saving the life of a road accident victim, the ‚Çπ5,000 reward under this scheme will be divided between them, he said.

‚ÄúIf more than one Good Samaritan saves the life of more than one victim of a fatal accident involving a motor vehicle, the amount of award will be ‚Çπ5,000 per victim saved subject to maximum ‚Çπ5,000 per Good Samaritan,‚Äù he said quoting the circular.

Janardhan further said the State-level appraisal committee comprises the Home Department Additional Chief Secretary, Health Secretary and M.P. Transport Commissioner besides ADG Traffic & Road safety.

He said there will be ten national-level awards each year for the worthiest Good Samaritans who will be selected from all those who have been awarded during the entire year and they would additionally be given an award of ‚Çπ1 lakh each, a letter of appreciation and a trophy.","Under the ‚ÄúGood Samaritan Scheme,‚Äô any person who saves the life of a victim of a road accident by rushing him to a hospital or a trauma centre would be rewarded with ‚Çπ5,000.

437,Good Samaritans to be paid ‚Çπ5k for rushing road accident victims to hospital,"The road ministry on Monday said it has launched a scheme for 'Good Samaritans' under which a cash award of ‚Çπ5,000 will be given to those who save the life of a road accident victim by rushing him/her to hospital within the 'golden hour' of the mishap.

In a letter to principal and transport secretaries of all states and union territories, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) said the scheme would be effective from October 15, 2021 till March 31, 2026.

The ministry on Monday issued guidelines for the ""scheme for grant of award to the Good Samaritan who has saved life of a victim of a fatal accident involving a motor vehicle by administering immediate assistance and rushing to hospital/trauma Care Centre within the Golden Hour of the accident to provide medical treatment.""

""Every cash award would be accompanied with a certification of appreciation,"" it added.

Besides award in each case, the ministry said there will be 10 national level awards for the most worthy Good Samaritans (to be selected from all those who have been awarded during the whole year) and they would be given an award of ‚Çπ1,00,000 each.

According to the guidelines, if more than one Good Samaritan saves the life of more than one victim, the amount of award will be ‚Çπ5,000 per victim saved, subject to maximum ‚Çπ5,000 per Good Samaritan.

440,"Mask on, but no helmet results in head injury cases","Express News Service

BENGALURU: While it is essential to wear a mask in these times of the Covid pandemic, many two-wheeler riders prefer to wear masks but not helmets while riding their bikes, resulting in a maximum number of head injuries.

Overspeeding and alcohol consumption remain the two main reasons for road accidents resulting in minor and severe head injuries. The National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), however, has observed that the patients were wearing masks, but not helmets at the time of the accident.

Dr Dhaval Shukla, professor of the Department of Neurosurgery, NIMHANS, said, ‚ÄúTwo-wheeler riders can wear a full-face helmet, which also acts as a mask. Though we have not done a proper study on the number of such patients, we have seen many without a helmet, but with a mask ending up with head injuries. One should understand that accidents can be prevented.‚Äù

The common reason given by bikers is that they cannot wear the helmet and mask together as it is suffocating, while others said that they are fined for not wearing a mask and not the helmet.

At Aster RV Hospital, 184 cases of head injury were reported between January and September 2021.

Dr Mohammed Imran Soherwardi, Consultant ‚Äì Emergency Medicine, Aster RV Hospital, said that they have seen a slight increase in cases after the second lockdown was lifted. ‚ÄúIncreased number of head injuries could be due to fogging of spectacles or helmets of riders while wearing the mask.‚Äù

Meanwhile, Dr Shukla pointed during the initial phases of the pandemic when the lockdown was announced the trauma centre at NIIMHANS saw only 5-6 cases of head injury per day, however, once it was lifted over 25 plus cases were reported. On the day the government lifted curbs on alcohol over 69 head injuries were reported. ""Nearly 70% are mild while 20-40% are moderate to severe where they land in a coma,"" added Dr Shukla.

While at Manipal Hospital Old Airport Road over 1505 trauma cases were reported from October 2020 till date. 1 60% increase was seen in traffic accidents in two-wheelers and some on four-wheelers. ""By enlarging it is motor vehicle accidents. the Trauma cases have now increased due to the increase in traffic and movement of people. Bikers are not seen wearing helmets and traffic lights are not wearing in many places which allows overspeeding. The 20-25 age group are usually seen with trauma cases. The accident is an incident which can be avoided easily, once people are careful on the roads.""","Overspeeding and alcohol consumption remain the two main reasons for road accidents resulting in minor and severe head injuries.

Staff Reporter :

Justice (retd) Abhay Sapre, Chairman of Road Safety Committee constituted by the Supreme Court, holds meeting in city and asks officials to make efforts to reduce road accidents

‚ÄúViolation of speed limit is the main reason behind most road mishaps. As many as 69 per cent of road accidents happen because of this. Hence, Police Department and Transport Department need to implement the rules in this regard strictly and create deterrence against violation. This will help reduce road accidents and save lives,‚Äù said Justice (retd) Abhay Sapre, Road Safety Committee constituted by the Supreme Court. Justice Abhay Manohar Sapre was speaking at a meeting of the committee, at Hotel Pride here on Sunday. Dr Bhushankumar Upadhyay, Additional Director General of Police (Highways); Dr Avinash Dhakne, Transport Commissioner; Vimala R, District Collector; Aswathi Dorje, Joint Commissioner of Police; Sarang Awad, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic); Vijaykumar Magar, Superintendent of Police, Nagpur Rural; Yogesh Kumbhejkar, Chief Executive Officer of Zilla Parishad; Dr D V Paturkar, Civil Surgeon; Wadettiwar, General Manager of National Highway Authority of India; Khanderao Deshmukh, Regional Transport Officer; Bajrang Kharmate, Deputy Regional Transport Officer, Nagpur Rural; and other officers attended the meeting.

Addressing the officers, Justice Sapre observed that loss of life and financial loss incurred due to road accident had long-term impacts on the lives of family members of accident victims. Hence, the issue of road accidents should be handled with sensitivity. He also spoke on measures to be taken to reduce the number of road accidents and number of fatalities. ‚ÄúThe quality of road construction should be ensured.

The works relating to ‚ÄòBlack Spots‚Äô should be completed expeditiously, and quality check should be carried out after completion of work to assess if number of accidents at these spots came down, he added. Justice Sapre emphasised upon the need for making the people aware of various aspects of road safety by way of effective co-ordination among agencies concerned. The persons injured in road mishaps must get medical treatment immediately, and other related actions should be taken expeditiously. Government may construct good roads, have speed-breakers, traffic sign-boards at appropriate locations. However, he observed, ‚ÄúIt is for the people to wear helmet, use seat-belt, not go wrong side, not ride/drive in an inebriated condition, and follow self-discipline as well as traffic rules.‚Äù He appealed to the agencies concerned to implement awareness drives regularly.","‚Äò69% of road mishaps due to violation of speed limit‚ÄôJustice (retd) Abhay Sapre interacting with officers including Dr Bhushankumar Upadhyay, Additional DG (Highways); Aswathi Dorje, Joint Commissioner of Police, and others, during a meeting held here on Sunday.

444,Road safety:IIT researchers working on first-of-its kind geography based smart speed warning system By Gu,"



New Delhi: Researchers at different Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are working on development of a first-of-its kind ""smart speed warning system"" for vehicles which will alert the driver on the basis of road infrastructure and geographical location to avoid over-speeding related crashes.

According to statistics available with the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, about 70 per cent of road fatalities in India occur due to over-speeding.

To minimise such fatalities, the government had mandated that all new cars sold from July 1, 2019, should include a speed governor device that will generate intermittent warning beeps for above 80 kmph and the constant beep for above 120 kmph for drivers. To further reduce damage to lives, the fine for speeding was increased by ten times under the new Motor Vehicles Act of 2019.

However, the researchers at IIT Guwahati and Bombay believe the current speed governing device is a ""one size fits all"" solution and does not have much intelligence and the same system cannot effectively work while driving in hilly terrains, plains or desert areas.

""Our studies revealed the safe speed for a vehicle can significantly vary with changes in road geometry like on sharp or blind curves or hairpin bends. Therefore, there is a need to develop a smart speed warning system incorporating a dynamic and adaptable speed threshold based on upcoming road infrastructure to avoid overspeeding-related crashes,"" Akhilesh Kumar Maurya, Civil Engineering Professor at IIT Guwahati, told PTI.

""Traditional warning systems are based on the fixed speed threshold, however, the concept of a smart warning system is based on upcoming road infrastructure and vehicle location. On approaching curves along a roadway, including blind curves or hairpin bends, vehicles equipped with such a system will warn drivers in advance, which will allow drivers to adopt corrective actions and avoid accidents,"" he added.

The researchers, who are in process of filing a patent for the system, claim that such a system is not available anywhere across the globe.

According to the team, algorithm for the smart speed warning system was developed based on the field data collected from a 45 km stretch of four-lane highway (NH-40) between Jorabat in Assam and Nongpoh in Meghalaya, consisting of 285 horizontal curves. The study section covered a broader range of road geometry (curve radius ranges from 20-800m, curve length varies from 30-244 m and gradient varied from seven per cent to nine per cent.

""We are in the process of analysing data of two-lane undivided highway NH-61 between Mumbai and Malshej Ghat in Maharashtra. We have now completed our pilot studies along four-lane divided highway, NH-160 between Thane and Nashik (Maharashtra) and now planning to collect detailed data very soon,"" Maurya said.

The team plans to conduct similar pilot studies at different highways across the country to get an idea of different geographical locations and present the model ultimately to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).

During the pilot studies of speed prediction model development, the researchers came up with car speed model and HCV and LCV speed model.

According to Avijit Maji, Associate Professor at IIT Bombay's Civil Engineering department, researchers have used operating speed of vehicles as one of the surrogate measures for safety evaluation of horizontal curves

""Now, the 85th percentile speed of vehicles in free-flow condition is widely considered as the operating speed. However, the geometric features of highways are designed on the basis of design speed. Some studies pointed out that the design speed might be represented by 95th to 98th percentile speed of vehicles in free-flow condition,"" he described in a paper published in the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) journal.

""Drivers in developing nations are not well disciplined and often drive solely based on their perception of the road geometry. Hence, the 98th percentile vehicle speed can be useful in evaluating safety of a highway section in such country. Now, the available vehicle speed prediction models vary widely. Differences in driver behaviour and highway geometry might be the reasons for these variations,"" he added.

Another research scholar from the team asserted that studies show that the decision-making process and driver performance greatly depends on situational awareness.

""Drivers intend to operate vehicles at safe speed based on the roadway geometric features. These features are characterised by gradient, horizontal curvature, length of curves and tangent sections, superelevation, etc. Perceptive and consistent geometric characteristics of the roadway can ease the decision making burden and thus minimise driver error.

""So far, majority of the studies on geometric design consistency are conducted on isolated curve sections in plain terrain for traffic with strong lane discipline. The effect of gradient is not significant in these terrains. Further, the driving behaviour of traffic with weak lane discipline is not represented in these studies,"" he described.","New Delhi: Researchers at different Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are working on development of a first-of-its kind ""smart speed warning system"" for vehicles which will alert the driver on the basis of road infrastructure and geographical location to avoid over-speeding related crashes.

445,Five killed in accidents during Puja days in Tripura,"Five people were killed and 13 sustained injuries in separate accidents amid Puja festivities in Tripura, including one person who got crushed beneath a Durga idol during immersion at Lefunga in West Tripura, the police said. Besides, a case of gang rape was registered in Dhalai district‚Äôs Salema.

Speaking to indianexpress.com, Inspector General (law and order) Arindam Nath said a road accident left two dead in 43 Mile area of Mungiyakami in Khowai district, 40 km from Agartala, on Tuesday when a car travelling from Ambassa in Dhalai district towards Teliamura in Khowai allegedly lost control near a curve and fell into a deep gorge.

‚ÄúFive persons were reported to have died in four accidents. Among these, one person fell beneath a Durga Puja idol at Lefunga. Two others died when a vehicle rolled down a gorge. Two others were killed in road accidents,‚Äù the official said.

According to officials at the police headquarters, 13 persons sustained injuries in road accidents at Champahower in Khowai district. This includes two traffic police personnel, one of whom was hit by a speeding vehicle which tried to flee after violating traffic rules at Teliamura. Three others were injured after a brick-laden truck fell into a ditch at Jogirampara area of Madhupur in West Tripura.

Meanwhile, three persons were arrested in the wake of the gang-rape case registered on Thursday at Salema police station, the IG informed. Further investigation in the case is underway, he said.

The official added that as many as 7,660 police personnel were deployed across the state to maintain law and order and oversee traffic movement during Durga Puja days this year. Besides, eight platoons of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were deployed in areas under eight major police stations to strengthen security measures and ensure that the festive season was peaceful.

As per reports, Durga Puja was celebrated in 2,176 pandals and other locations across Tripura, including 865 pujas organised in urban areas and 1,311 in rural areas. Sensitive places were kept under CCTV surveillance.

Power cuts were reported in different parts of the state ‚Äì especially at Udaipur in Gomati district ‚Äì leaving residents in discomfort. Sources in the Met Department attributed the increased sensation of heat to high levels of humidity. Meanwhile, there were also reports of disruption in drinking water supply.

Appealing for religious cooperation and brotherhood, Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb met leaders of all religious communities on Bijoya Dashami and exchanged pleasantries.","Five people were killed and 13 sustained injuries in separate accidents amid Puja festivities in Tripura, including one person who got crushed beneath a Durga idol during immersion at Lefunga in West Tripura, the police said.

447,Assam Records Over 500 Road Accidents In The Midst Of Durga Puja Festivities - Sentinelassam,"Guwahati: This year, the Assam Government has imposed strict protocols and guidelines during the Durga Puja celebrations as a measure against the spread of coronavirus. Meanwhile, over 500 road accidents were recorded in Assam during the festivities season.

In a report issued by the state emergency services, a total of 541 road accidents were reported in Assam.

A total of 49 road accidents were reported in Kamrup Rural while 48 road accidents were reported in the Golaghat district. The districts of Sonitpur and Tinsukia both reported a total of 32 accidents.

In the last 5 days of the festivities season, 8 road accidents were reported in Kamrup metro.

On October 14, the day of Navami, 137 road accidents were reported making it the highest number compared to other days.

In a report issued by the emergency services, the data gives an idea about the number of accidents that took place between October 11 and 15.

Upon being asked if there was a rise in accident cases this Puja season, he answered, ""Last year there were no Durga Puja celebrations so there were no major accidents as such. In normal days, we cater to about 70 to 80 accidents per day but these days it has gone up to hundred on some days.""

448,At least 13 auto safety rules are years overdue,"WASHINGTON: After their 16-year-old daughter died in a car crash, David and Wendy Mills wondered whether she would be alive if federal rules on rear seat belt warnings had been issued on time.Four years later, with no rule and traffic fatalities spiking, they're still at a loss over the inaction.The teenager was riding in the back seat of a car to a Halloween party in 2017 just a mile from her house in Spring, Texas, when she unfastened her seat belt to slide next to her friend and take a selfie. Moments later, the driver veered off the road and the car flipped, ejecting her.Kailee died instantly. Her three friends who remained buckled walked away with minor scrapes.A 2012 law had directed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an agency of the Department of Transportation, to implement safety rules requiring car manufacturers to install a warning to drivers if an unbuckled passenger is sitting in a rear seat. The agency had three years to act.But the regulation wasn't done when Kailee climbed into her friend's car, though it's been estimated that it could save hundreds of lives each year. It's one of more than a dozen car safety rules now years overdue, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.The ever-growing docket has become one of the biggest tests for the federal agency since its founding in 1970, when public pressure led by safety activist Ralph Nader spurred NHTSA 's mission to ""save lives, prevent injuries and reduce economic costs due to road traffic crashes.""Advocates worry that the agency has lost focus and risks getting bogged down under President Joe Biden, at a time of increasing road accidents and reckless driving during the COVID-19 pandemic.""We need a call to action,"" said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association. He called the pandemic surge in accidents a ""car crash epidemic.""The rules backlog would only increase with the sweeping technological requirements included in a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill pending in Congress, from new breathalyzer devices that would disable a car if a driver is drunk to stiffer standards for reporting safety recalls.Currently, the 600-employee federal agency lacks a permanent leader. Its acting administrator is Steven Cliff, a former deputy executive officer at the California Air Resources Board, which regulates auto emissions, a key component of Biden's climate agenda.""Government should not take this long to act on safety,"" said David Mills, who started a Houston-area foundation in Kailee's honor aimed at promoting seat belt safety. The foundation keeps a list, known as ""Kailee's Angels,"" of some of the teenagers around the country who died in car crashes after failing to buckle up.""It's devastating to families,"" he said.The rear seat belt reminder requirement is now scheduled to start moving through the cumbersome regulatory process in January, but a final rule could be years away. The agency in the past has repeatedly blown past deadlines, including those promised in federal court.The AP review of NHTSA's rule-making activities under the last three presidents found at least 13 auto safety rules that are years overdue based on deadlines set in laws passed by Congress.In most cases, those rules are opposed by powerful industries as expensive, outdated or restrictive. Other pending rules have been slowed by the bureaucracy or taken a back seat to other priorities under Democratic presidents. For example, a 2011 initiative that large commercial vehicles be equipped with devices to limit their speed was recently put on indefinite hold by Biden.President Donald Trump sidetracked at least four major road safety proposals, including medical evaluations of commercial truck drivers for sleep apnea.Pending rules include side-impact standards for child car seats, originally due in 2014. Attorneys general of 17 states and the District of Columbia wrote to the Biden administration in July, urging immediate action. Other pending rules would require car manufacturers to maintain records of safety defects for at least 10 years, as required by Congress and originally due in 2017, and anti-ejection protection measures for larger buses, due in 2014.Standards for ""smart"" car headlights, begun in 2018, are incomplete despite car industry support. Smart headlights would adjust a high intensity light to oncoming traffic, so drivers don't have to toggle between high and low beams.NHTSA declined to make Cliff available for comment. The agency instead released a list of steps it has taken to address auto safety, including recently announced proposed fuel economy standards that Biden has promoted to confront climate change.The agency points in part to plans to require or set standards for automatic emergency braking systems on new passenger vehicles and heavy trucks, a reversal from the Trump administration, and to move forward on some of the delayed regulations, though it did not offer firm guarantees on timing.NHTSA has pledged to require what it said are rigorous testing standards for autonomous vehicles and set up a national database to document automated-vehicle crashes. It has prodded electric vehicle maker Tesla to recall dark touch screens and is investigating the company's Autopilot partially automated driving system's failure to stop for parked emergency vehicles.In recent public remarks, Cliff said the agency is committed to address rising traffic fatalities and he stressed a ""transformational and collaborative approach to safety.""Jason Levine, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, and other consumer groups have been urging Biden to quickly nominate an agency leader. The last Senate-confirmed NHTSA administrator served under President Barack Obama until 2017.""You have a Biden administration it seems across the board more interested in acting in a regulatory fashion than the previous administration,"" Levine said. ""That's why there's so much excitement, but also quite frankly frustration that things aren't moving with a greater sense of urgency.""The Alliance for Auto Innovation, which is the trade association representing all auto manufacturers but Tesla, declined to comment for this story.Automakers have made some progress on safety issues on their own or in voluntary agreements with the government. For instance, 20 companies agreed with NHTSA in 2016 to make automatic emergency braking standard on at least 95% of their new passenger vehicles by Sept. 1, 2022. At least 10 have already met the goal. Two years ago, 20 auto companies agreed to install electronic reminders to check back seats so drivers don't leave children in hot cars. The industry would install the reminders in new vehicles by the 2025 model year.The Governors Highway Safety Association has been strongly pushing for rear seat belt reminders since 2015, noting back then that fewer passengers were buckling up in the back when riding in increasingly popular Uber, Lyft and other for-hire vehicles.Last year, over half of all crash fatalities involved unbelted drivers or occupants, the highest level since 2012, according to NHTSA.An estimated 38,680 people were killed in traffic crashes in 2020, the highest total since 2007, even though total miles driven dropped due to stay-at-home orders at the beginning of the pandemic. In the first three months of 2021, 8,730 people died in motor vehicle traffic crashes, a 10.5% increase from the same period last year.More than 800 people who were unbelted in the back seat die in car crashes each year, and an analysis of NHTSA's data by the governors' group found that wearing seat belts would have saved more than half of them.Those grim statistics and rising fatalities have spurred states in recent months to seek ways to boost seat belt use, such as with ""Click it or Ticket"" law enforcement campaigns. In Connecticut, a law signed by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont took effect this month that requires all rear seat passengers 16 and older to wear a seat belt. Those under 16 already had been required to buckle up.Adkins said state highway safety officials were heartened to see Biden elevate Jennifer Homendy, a former congressional staffer and member of the National Transportation Safety Board who has spent two decades working on transportation safety, to NTSB chair. In recent months, she's appeared with Lamont to promote the new rear seat belt law, railed against Tesla's ""misleading"" marketing that she says puts lives at risk and called for stronger federal safety standards.But as NTSB head, she has no actual regulatory authority, and the buzz at a recent governors' safety conference was the impact she could have if she were NHTSA's administrator.""We need a NHTSA administrator who is confirmed and has the political ability to get some things done,"" Adkins said. ""There's no time for a learning curve. We're in a bad spot in traffic safety. We've got work to do. And we need the administration's attention.""Various NHTSA delays have led to a patchwork of safety features initiated by the auto industry that have no clear minimum level of standards, said Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. Many of the features also are typically sold in high-end cars or luxury packages, in effect imposing an ""upcharge"" for consumer safety.She noted that a 2008 congressional mandate to install backup cameras in passenger vehicles took NHTSA 10 years and a lawsuit by her group and others before the rule was finally implemented; the original deadline was 2011.Meanwhile, the European Union began requiring seat belt reminder systems in the front and rear seats of new cars in September 2019.""I can't say the U.S. regulator of the auto industry is at all on track,"" Chase said. ""We're years behind at this point. I don't want to be critical because they are still in their first year, but the infancy of the new administration will soon expire, and it's time for them to move forward.""","""Government should not take this long to act on safety,"" said David Mills, who started a Houston-area foundation in Kailee's honor aimed at promoting seat belt safety.

452,India accounts for 11 per cent of global death in road accidents: World Bank,"With only 1 per cent of the world's vehicles, India accounts for 11 per cent of the global death in road accidents, the highest in the world, according to a report by the World Bank.

The country accounts for about 4.5 lakh road crashes per annum, in which 1.5 lakh people die.

""India tops the world in road crash deaths and injuries. It has 1 per cent of the world's vehicles but accounts for 11 per cent of all road crash deaths, witnessing 53 road crashes every hour; killing 1 person every 4 minutes,"" the report said.

In the last decade, 13 lakh people died and another 50 lakh got injured on Indian roads, it said.

""Considering the under reporting phenomenon and using the crash ratios for the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways crash numbers"", the report estimates the crash costs at Rs 5.96 lakh crore or 3.14 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).

The 2019 World Bank report, titled 'Guide for Road Safety Opportunities and Challenges: Low- and Middle-Income Countries Country Profiles', puts the road crash and serious injury cost estimate at 7.5 per cent of India's GDP or Rs 12.9 lakh crore for 2016. It is more than twice the figure cited by the government at 3 per cent of GDP or Rs 4.3 lakh crore, it added.

A recent study commissioned by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) estimates the socio-economic costs of road crashes at Rs 1,47,114 crore in India, which is equivalent to 0.77 per cent of the country's GDP.

""Considering the under reporting phenomenon and using the crash ratios for MoRTH crash numbers, the same study estimates the crash costs at Rs 5.96 lakh crores i.e. equivalent to 3.14 per cent,"" it said.

At the individual level, road crash injuries and deaths impose a severe financial burden and push entire (non-poor) households into poverty and the already poor into debt.

As per the Ministry, 76.2 per cent of people who are killed in road crashes are in their prime working-age, 18-45 years.

Globally, road traffic injuries (RTIs) are the eighth leading cause of death.

‚ÄòPoor, male road-users of working age, constitute VRU category‚Äô

According to the World Bank, the road crash fatality rate is three times higher in low-income countries compared to high-income countries, and statistics from India further reinforce this global trend.

There is a distinct correlation between socio-economic status and road use patterns in low- and middle-income countries like India and ""poor people are more likely to be involved in a road traffic crash"", it said.

In a country like India, where vulnerable road users are forced to share space with other less vulnerable road users, the income level of an individual has a direct bearing on the mode of transport used.

This in turn further determines the level of risk faced by a particular road user. The report said daily wage workers and workers employed as casual labourers in informal activities are more prone to be defined as vulnerable compared to workers engaged in regular activities.

""It is no coincidence, then, that it is often the poor, especially male road-users of working age, that constitute the category of vulnerable road users (VRUs) in India.

""VRUs bear a disproportionately large burden of road crashes and account for more than half of all road crash deaths and serious injuries in the country,"" it said.

As the world navigates through the Covid-19 pandemic, the road crash pandemic continues to fester the socio-economic landscape in India, the report said.

On Saturday, Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Nitin Gakdari has termed road accident scenario in India more ""dangerous than the Covid-19 pandemic"". He has said there could be a saving of Rs 90 lakh per person by preventing deaths and reducing injuries to minor ones in such incidents.

The Minister had stressed that the accident cost is a tremendous burden to society and the nation, and the estimated cost of a death in a road accident is around Rs 91.16 lakh.

Releasing the World Bank report on 'Traffic Crash Injuries And Disabilities: The Burden on India Society', Gadkari had said that in this alarming scenario, his ministry will formulate policies to protect the interest of the poor and embark on several reformative steps.","With only 1 per cent of the world's vehicles, India accounts for 11 per cent of the global death in road accidents, the highest in the world, according to a report by the World Bank.

453,"Poor enforcement, training: The reasons why there are so many road accidents in India","Road accidents cost India 3-5% of gross domestic product every year, and are avoidable if India could improve its roads and city planning, train its drivers better, and enforce traffic laws properly, an Indiaspend analysis shows.

India‚Äôs young, productive population, aged 18-45 years, is involved in 70% of road accidents, according to data from Road Accidents in India 2018, a report published by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.

Over a period of 24 years from 2014 to 2038, if India could halve the deaths and injuries due to road traffic, its GDP could increase by 7%, a 2018 World Bank report said.

In 2018, India had 467,044 reported road accidents, an increase of 0.5% from 464,910 in 2017, according to the road ministry‚Äôs data.

India has 1% of the world‚Äôs vehicles but accounts for 6% of the world‚Äôs road traffic accidents, according to data from a 2018 World Health Organization report. As many as 73% of all deaths due to road traffic accidents in 2018 in the South and South-East Asia region happened in India, the report said.

Road accidents are one of the 12 most common causes of deaths in India, the ninth most common cause of premature deaths, and the 10th most common reason for disability, according to the 2017 WHO Global Health Estimates.

In 2018, of all road deaths, the most were of those riding two-wheelers (36%), followed by pedestrians (15%), ministry data shows.

Speeding and drink driving

The two most frequent causes of road deaths are speeding and drunk driving, followed by a lack of lane discipline (driving on the wrong side), jumping the red light and the use of a mobile phone while driving, data shows.

Overspeeding is the most common cause of deaths on roads in India, with 64% of road deaths because of speeding. Sixty per cent of the accidents in India occur on highways, mostly because of speeding, said Piyush Tewari from Save a Life Foundation.

The most deaths due to speeding were in Rajasthan (9,618 deaths), followed by Tamil Nadu (9,224 deaths) and Karnataka (8,714 deaths).

The fine for speeding has increased from Rs 500 to Rs 5,000 since September, 2019 under the new Motor Vehicles Act of 2019. In addition, drivers could also be imprisoned for three months for speed racing ‚Äì an illegal race ‚Äì if it is their first offence, and for a period of one year if it is the second offence, according to the law.

The current speed limit in the country is 80 km per hour on a 4-lane highway. However, the WHO has recommended that if we reduce the speed limit to about 55-57 km per hour, we could save around 30%-37% lives, said Patanjali Nayyar, regional advisor for the WHO.

Accidents due to drunk driving ‚Äì under the influence of alcohol or drugs ‚Äì declined by 14% between 2017 and 2018 because of an increase in fines and better implementation of laws, mostly in metro cities, and because of greater media coverage of the issue, according to experts.

The new motor vehicles law increased punishment for the first offence to imprisonment up to six months and/or fine up to Rs 10,000, and for the second offence to two years and/or fine of Rs 15,000. Earlier, the fine was Rs 2,000 or six months for the first offence and Rs 3,000 or two years imprisonment, according to the Motor Vehicles Act 1989.

Poor enforcement

India‚Äôs traffic laws are stricter than those of other countries but these laws are not enforced.

In many other countries, such as the UK, Australia, New Zealand, where they have better enforcement, the alcohol is limit is 0.08 mg/l, higher than the 0.05 mg/l in India, said Nayyar of the WHO. ‚ÄúIn many countries crashes due to alcohol have been reduced due to enforcement of their laws and education.‚Äù

India‚Äôs enforcement of laws on speeding and drunk driving are rated 3 and 4 out of 10, respectively, compared to 8 and 9 in China and 9 (for both) in Sri Lanka, by the Global Road Safety Report 2018, that analysed traffic laws of 175 countries.

India has a paucity of traffic police ‚Äì 30% of 85,144 traffic policemen positions and 39% of 58,509 sanctioned traffic constable positions were vacant in 2018, according to data from the Bureau of Police Research and Development.

Enforcement of laws can reduce drunk driving, said Tewari of Save a Life Foundation, and gave the example of Satyendra Garg, who was the joint commissioner of traffic in New Delhi in 2012 and would conduct random ‚Äúanti-drink and drive drives‚Äù almost every day. Because of the fear of these checks, people stopped drinking and driving, Tewari said. Over 12,000 people were prosecuted for drunk driving in New Delhi in 2011, up from 8,648 in 2010, according to data from the International Road Federation, a global non-profit working on road safety.

‚ÄúWhen it comes to enforcement we know human behaviour is affected by enforcement and in India, enforcement is largely driven by human beings and is prone to corruption,‚Äù said Tewari. He suggests using artificial intelligence, in the form of road sensors to detect speed, and adaptive traffic lighting (in which traffic signal timing changes, or adapts, based on actual traffic demand) for enforcing traffic laws, such as in Sri Lanka and Bhutan.

City planning

On many roads there are no traffic-calming measures such as speed humps before intersections or median barriers, Tewari said.

Roads should be made not just for use by four-wheelers but also for two-wheelers and pedestrians, and towns should be planned not just for expressways and commercial areas but also for hawkers and vendors, Nayyar said. For instance, safer highways should be created by adding underpasses for pedestrians, especially those that are vulnerable, such as pregnant women and the elderly.

Nayyar gave the example of the Delhi-Agra highway where the highway has divided villages, but there are no pedestrian crossings. ‚ÄúHow do we expect people whose village has been divided by that highway to crossover to their fields everyday? There are some villages on this stretch of the highway that are villages of widows due to the deaths caused by road accidents,‚Äù Nayyar said.

Driver training

In 2018, in 26% of all road accidents, drivers who were in an accident did not have a valid license or were driving with a learner‚Äôs license, ministry data shows.

In any case, licences are not a sign that the driver is qualified, experts said.

For example, if we go out and ask drivers about the three-second rule (which ensures driving at a safe speed, and the distance between two vehicles) or whether they are aware of a blindspot in their vehicle while driving, 99% will not know because they have not received any sort of formal training, said Tewari.

‚ÄúBasically we made a road and allowed untrained drivers...Drivers need hard skills training on driving, not just ads and awareness,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe have announced that we will reduce traffic deaths by 50%. This is a joke unless and until we combine efforts in the four E‚Äôs: engineering, enforcement, education, and emergency response,‚Äù Tewari said.

Data management systems

India had about 300,000 road deaths in 2016, almost double the government estimate of 151,000 deaths, according to the 2018 Global Road Safety report of the WHO, highlighting the lack of quality road accident data.

‚ÄúThe data is deeply fractured‚Ä¶ The biggest challenge in data collection in road accidents is the crash investigation report. When a crash occurs very little is done to determine the cause of the crash. Attempt is made to fix the responsibility on the driver of the bigger car,‚Äù said Piyush Tewari.

For instance, in states where alcohol is banned, such as Bihar, Nagaland and Gujarat, there has been a decline in accidents due to drunk driving, data shows.

‚ÄúMy sense is that the more you ban something, the more people are likely to do it,‚Äù Tewari said. But not all states have a good data management system, so they might be under-reporting accidents or not managing the data well, he explained.

‚ÄúThe state of Kerala has banned alcohol, but it also has a very good data recording system,‚Äù Tewari said. In Kerala, drunk driving accidents increased from 35 in 2014 to 133 in 2017. Alcohol was banned in the state between 2014 and 2017.

Goa, with the highest per capita availability of alcohol, had no road deaths due to drunk driving in 2016, which is likely to be because of an error in collecting information on accidents, Tewari said. In 2018, Goa reported nine accidents due to drunk driving and four deaths.

Often, traffic police do not have the necessary equipment to determine the cause of an accident. For instance, most police report a case of drunk driving only through smelling, since most of them do not have a breathalyzer, especially in smaller cities, said Patanjali Dev Nayyar, the regional advisor for disability, injury prevention and rehabilitation at WHO.

‚ÄúIf the police arrive late at the scene of the accident, it is difficult to determine whether alcohol was involved,‚Äù Daniel Keniston, an assistant professor at Yale University, told IndiaSpend in July 2017.

454,India's gig economy and the question of quality jobs,"In August this year, Zomato launched the Har Customer Hai Star ad-campaign on TV featuring Katrina Kaif and Hrithik Roshan with the obvious intention of communicating that every customer was as important as a celebrity customer.

While some called it creative, the majority felt that the campaign was an attempt to divert attention from the payouts and working conditions of its gig workforce. Similarly, the on and off protests by the drivers of cab aggregators and the delivery partners of e-commerce and food delivery companies also underlined some of the issues faced by the gig workers. Apart from criticism around the harsh working conditions, the quality of work and the temporary nature of engagement, absence of a social security net, long hours, delayed payouts, and needless pressure to maximize speed of delivery even at the risk of road accidents have all invited disapproval.

E-commerce in India is a nascent industry that is probably less than 13 years old. In this short period, it has captured the collective imagination of the nation. The covid-19 crisis has accelerated its adoption, and even die-hard fans of shopping at a physical store have switched to shopping online. The rapid growth, astronomical valuations and runaway success of this industry has drawn a mix of both admiration and loathing, some deserved and some undeserved.

Some of the concerns are fair and call for introspection on the part of e-commerce companies, and highlight the inconvenient truth‚Äîthe bigger an industry gets, and the more successful it is perceived to be, the more responsible and thoughtful it needs to be in everything it does. However, some of the criticism is unreasonable and could potentially lead to premature and unrealistic regulation, which in turn could harm the stakeholders including the gig workers.

To understand this issue holistically and take a balanced position, we need to step back a bit and look at some of the realities of India‚Äôs ‚Äòjobs problem‚Äô. If you forget where you came from and what got you here, you are likely to take the wrong decisions.

India is a demographically youthful nation, and every year between 17 and 20 million people look for jobs. This includes around 5 million people who are abandoning highly exploitative and less remunerative farm jobs every year to find employment in other sectors, mostly in the nearest urban districts. To put this in perspective, the information technology (IT) and business process outsourcing industry that has been the pride of the nation created, on an average, less than 200,000 jobs a year during its 25 years of existence. This is just a minuscule 1% of the total number of jobs that need to be created.

Let‚Äôs quickly do another interesting and back of the envelope calculation: India‚Äôs gross domestic product (GDP) is nearly $3 trillion and assuming a realistic annual growth rate of 6%, it translates into a GDP expansion of $180 billion a year. It‚Äôs a well-known fact that in India, the share of wages is around 50% of GDP. This amounts to $90 billion.

If you divide this by the number of jobs that need to be created every year (20 million), the average wage rate per job is ‚Çπ3.4 lakh per annum or roughly ‚Çπ28,000 per month. And given the fact that the really well-paying jobs (roughly 10% of the total) account for approximately 50% of the wages, it‚Äôs quite evident that a majority of jobs will pay significantly lower than the average of ‚Çπ28,000.

This is clearly borne out by data from the Central Statistics Office‚Äôs (CSO) report on jobs dated 15 September 2016. If the average wage rate of these 20 million new jobs had to be say ‚Çπ60,000 per month, the economy would have to be growing at a rate of 15% per annum. So, creating high paying jobs was never easy and will never be easy; and nor is it realistic that every one, or even a majority of the 20 million, will be employed in high paying jobs.

According to CSO, only about 17% of India‚Äôs workers are regular wage earners and less than 23% of Indian households have a regular wage earner. In other words, 77% of our households did not have a steady flow of income. Self-employed (46%) and casual labour (33%) together account for nearly 80% of the workforce and claimed to earn less than ‚Çπ10,000 per month. These are the realities that cannot be ignored.

Expecting a nascent industry to not only move the needle but also transform the conditions of the labour market overnight‚Äîby an order of magnitude‚Äîis both unrealistic as well as unfair. Anyone complaining about the quality of jobs being created by the e-commerce industry probably needs to spend some time understanding the history of job creation in India.

So, where are these 17-20 million youth being absorbed every year currently? Clearly there is large-scale under-employment. And frankly what many of the new-age platforms have done is nothing short of a miracle both in terms of creating jobs as well as paying a fair wage.

Why marketplaces matter

Neither skill nor knowledge is enough to ensure one generates income. Creating jobs is also dependent on the ability to channelize both skills and knowledge into developing products and services that customers are willing to pay for. And this in turn sets the wheels of the economy in motion.

Economic activity is akin to traffic on a busy highway. From time to time, bottlenecks develop along this highway that choke the traffic and slow it down to a crawl or even create a complete gridlock. It needs the right triggers to unlock these bottlenecks. At times, these triggers are a result of conscious and thoughtful planning, but mostly a result of innovative application of existing or new technology. Once a bottleneck is released, the traffic flows smoothly for a while until another choke point gets created elsewhere that may probably need a different trigger to de-bottleneck.

A series of these bottlenecks and choke points had collectively grid-locked India into a ‚Äòmiddle income trap‚Äô for decades. One of the innovations that removed some of these bottlenecks is efficient online ‚Äòmarketplaces‚Äô enabled by technology.

A startup such as the Urban Company is an example of a technology-powered marketplace for common services such as plumbing, carpentry, beauty, and house-cleaning, among others. They brought consumers and suppliers of services (based on skills) on a common platform and made the whole process of matching demand and supply pretty seamless.

Plumbers, for example, no longer have to depend upon word of mouth or other inefficient methods for sourcing business. Inefficiencies that existed in matching demand and supply prior to the advent of platforms like these resulted in consumers having to live with substandard services provided by poorly skilled workers. Further, these workers did not have an incentive to up-skill because they knew that the inefficiencies in the discovery process for skills left the customers vulnerable and without a choice. Another disincentive to up-skill was the fact that earning capacity had little or no relationship with skill levels.

Technology platforms created by companies such as Urban Company improved the discovery process multifold. Every instance of service on these platforms was rated by the consumer. Plumbers with higher consumer ratings were given more business and hence an opportunity to earn more. Plumbers, therefore, learned the value of up-skilling and paying, if necessary, to up-skill.

A higher payout

A user is prepared to pay for learning something if the linkages to the benefits of learning are straightforward. And a consumer of a service is willing to pay more for better quality of service if there is a consistent and reliable process of evaluating the capability of service providers. Most of these workers were always self-employed and even with these platforms, they operate in a gig mode which isn‚Äôt structurally different.

However, the earnings have gone up significantly because of the ease of discovery and predictable flow of business. Most platforms have compensation structures that result in payouts beyond the minimum wages specified by the government, and this has implications on what it does to the broader consumption story of the economy. Many of the more enterprising gig workers on Urban Company platform consistently make more than ‚Çπ50,000 a month.

It‚Äôs not just Urban Company. Many of the recent startups such as Ola, Uber, and a host of others have unconsciously kicked off a revolution in the skilling and earnings journey. Youth from rural India had been joining the Ola and Uber platforms in large numbers. Many of them had migrated from rural farmlands, where they were either unemployed or heavily under-employed, to the nearest city or town to sign up for driving lessons by paying a fee.

No one had to push or nudge them because they knew that there was a real job at the end of it that paid them far more than what they had been making earlier. When skilling is voluntary and driven by a free market mechanism, the outcomes are magical.

One might wonder why these platforms should be considered game-changing. The platforms, per se, did not create a product or service that did not exist before. Cab services always existed. Plumbers, beauticians, carpenters and technicians were always around selling their services.

What these platforms did was ‚Äòindustrialize‚Äô the services‚Äîindustrialization allowed effortless consumption and created structured mechanisms to scale services and service capabilities. And here, lies the power of de-bottlenecking a serious choke point.

This de-bottlenecking was sufficient for free market forces to take over subsequently and create systemic trends and scale. Elimination of a single large bottleneck results in activating a virtuous cycle of ‚Äòincome growth‚Äô for service providers.

This, in turn, results in ‚Äònew consumption‚Äô which, in turn, leads to creation of more goods and service providers. We have been seeing a lot of this.

In short, these platforms lowered the barriers for consumption and production, which is an essential lubricant for the wheels of economic activity. They also shortened the feedback cycles which are such powerful triggers in a free market. The shorter the gap between an action and reward (or penalty), the faster the system tunes in to the right rhythm. So, the idea of rating every transaction by the consumer on these platforms shortened the feedback loop and led to instant course corrections and alignment.

The road ahead

India‚Äôs labour movement is more than a century old and quite mature. Entrepreneurs, too, have periodically formed industry associations to protect their interests. One of the main reasons why the IT industry has been able to avoid the formation of unions has been because of abundant opportunities in a growing industry for the employees, coupled with a fair pay structure and good working conditions.

As far as the e-commerce industry is concerned, there are several obvious lessons that can contribute towards its growth, going ahead. For instance, companies cannot seek rising valuations, on the one hand, and treat their gig workers unfairly, on the other.

At the same time, it is not fair to paint the entire industry as exploitative or be unduly critical of the gig model which is actually a very good model. Many of the gig workers themselves would be reluctant to take up full time and fixed salaried jobs. Pushing for premature regulation is like throwing the baby out with the bath water.

And finally, it is unrealistic to expect the e-commerce industry to create jobs that are probably as well paying or as fulfilling as their more upmarket cousin‚Äîthe IT industry.

455,IIT Madras Researchers developing Data-Driven Strategies to enhance Road Safety in Tamil Nadu,"CHENNAI : Indian Institute of Technology Madras Researchers are developing data-driven strategies to enhance road Safety in Tamil Nadu. Towards this, a one-day workshop on developing an action plan was organized today (12) by Center of Excellence for Human Factors and Safety Science @ RBG Labs, IIT Madras, in coordination with the National Health Mission.

Various stakeholders involved in road safety include the Police, Health, Transport, Road owning agencies, Education, Rural Development, and Local Self Government, among others, participated in the workshop held at IIT Madras Research Park.

The outcomes of this workshop will be used to help a focused action plan and be used as a policy advisory to help reduce road accidents and fatalities in Tamil Nadu.

Conveying his message for the workshop, Thiru Ma. Subramanian, Minister for Health, Medical Education and Family Welfare, Government of Tamil Nadu, said, ‚ÄúThis workshop is the first of many such design-thinking based strategizing workshops for road safety. This coordinated knowledge sharing session among all the road safety stakeholders in Tamil Nadu will be a pathway to continuously evolve successful road safety policies in the State.‚Äù

The key outcomes envisaged from this program include:

√ò Clear long term policies and strategies for moving towards an ‚Äòaccident-free Tamil Nadu‚Äô

√ò Short term strategies to improve road safety and minimize road traffic accidents during the next 3 months (November 2021 to January 2022)

√ò Action Points and Key Performance Indicators for each of the Stakeholder Departments, including Health, Police, Road owning agencies, Transport, Education and Local Bodies.

√ò Modalities for sharing and utilizing the data available with Stakeholder departments for collective action in ensuring road safety. For example, Grid Analysis data available with Health Departments shall be used for enforcement, preventive action awareness creation, among others, by the stakeholder departments concerned.

Elaborating on this engagement, Prof. Venkatesh Balasubramanian, Faculty In-Charge, Center of Excellence for Human Factors and Safety Science @ RBG Labs, IIT Madras, who is coordinating this workshop, said, ‚ÄúAvoiding accidents and fatalities in accidents is an essential requirement to be a developed nation. Roads are shared assets and the safety on them is a collective responsibility of all the stakeholders.‚Äù

Further, Prof. Venkatesh Balasubramanian said, ‚ÄúWe have been advocating a data-driven systems approach to road safety through our Transportation Safety Framework (TSF) to have a holistic improvement. While TN has been performing well on reducing the fatalities from road accidents, in 2021, after the lockdown there has been a steady increase in fatality. Therefore, it is quintessential to develop a good strategy based on data to address this on a priority basis. It is, therefore, necessary to have a design thinking approach to solve the problem by not just identifying the issues but implementing changes that are sustainable in the local conditions.‚Äù

In 2020, Tamil Nadu became the first State in India and globally, the only administered territory to have achieved a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target of reducing deaths due to road accidents by 50 per cent. However, there has been a steady increase in the number of road fatalities in 2021.

Speaking on the occasion, Prof. Ravindra Gettu, Dean (Industrial Consultancy and Sponsored Research), IIT Madras, said, ‚ÄúThe Action plan that has been drawn up is expected to make a significant impact on fatalities and road safety in general, especially due to the involvement of all stakeholders concerned through this design thinking approach.‚Äù

To curb the seasonal peak traffic crashes in the fourth quarter of 2021, a strategic team of TN stakeholders involved in road safety were identified to prepare a strategic short-term and long-term action plan for improving road safety in the State.

460,Using umbrella during rain can get you fined- Know about new rule,"As per a new rule established in the state of Kerala, people will have to pay a fine if they are carrying an umbrella during the rains while travelling during traffic. Fret not; this rule is only applicable for those who are travelling on a two-wheeled vehicle in Kerala.

As bizarre as this rule sounds, it will keep all the passengers and nearby pedestrians safe during the rainy season. People travelling via a bike are often seen using an open umbrella while they are moving through traffic, which can be very unsafe.

As Kerala receives a lot of rainfall, many people travelling on bikes and scooters were seen using umbrellas while driving. This lead to a dramatic rise in road accidents during the rains in Kerala, thus, this new rule has been imposed.

Keeping all these accidents in mind, the Transport Commissioner of Kerala has written a letter to all the traffic authorities to restrict travellers on two-wheelers from using umbrellas while driving their vehicles. The authorities have stated that using an umbrella while winds are moving at high speed is very dangerous, and can lead the person to get misbalanced and falling off.

Last month, a 52-year-old woman in Kerala fell off a motorcycle and injured herself while trying to open an umbrella on the moving vehicle. The woman, who was travelling with her son, suffered serious head injuries due to this incident, and later succumbed to them.

In view of these accidents, the traffic police in Kerala will keep a close watch on all those travelling by two-wheelers and challan will be issued if they don‚Äôt follow the newly implemented rule.","Fret not; this rule is only applicable for those who are travelling on a two-wheeled vehicle in Kerala.

464,"Tanzanian gold miners ten times more likely to die from road injuries, study finds","Miners were 10 times more likely to die of traffic-related injuries than people who did not work in mining, a study that looked at Tanzania‚Äôs two biggest gold mines found.

Africa has a third of the global stock of metals and minerals and hosts around 700 active large-scale mining sites, with more in the pipeline as the world‚Äôs appetite for these resources grows.

Of the 186 people of working age who died in five wards around the two mines in a year, about half were miners, reflecting the higher risks miners faced, especially men.

The study authors say that interventions should be designed to prevent road injuries in the wider community, not just at the mine sites, and the definition of safety in mining areas needs to be broader.

Mining areas are dangerous for many reasons: they‚Äôre linked to a heightened risk of cancer, poisoning, heart and respiratory diseases. Now, researchers have identified a hitherto overlooked hazard: roads.

Miners were 10 times more likely to die of traffic-related injuries than people who did not work in mining, according to a new study of Tanzania‚Äôs gold mines published in PLOS Global Public Health.

‚ÄúWe are not paying attention to road injury, but it is indeed a leading cause of death in these communities,‚Äù said Isaac Lyatuu, a public health specialist at Ifakara Health Institute in Dar es Salaam and first author of the paper. Focusing on the wider region rather than just the extraction zone is important to fully map the imprint of these operations, he said.

Africa has a third of the global stock of metals and minerals and hosts around 700 active large-scale mining sites. Modern technologies ‚Äî from mobile phones that use cobalt, to lithium-ion batteries ‚Äî are fueling the expansion of extractive activity on the continent.

Gold mining is big in Tanzania, accounting for nearly 90% of the East African nation‚Äôs mineral exports. The major importers of this gold are India, the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland.

Researchers tracked deaths in communities that live in the shadow of Tanzania‚Äôs two largest gold mines, located in the north of the country. South Africa-based AngloGold Ashanti owns the Geita gold mine in the eponymously named region, and Toronto-headquartered Barrick Gold Corporation controls the Bulyanhulu gold mine in the Shinyanga region.

Industrial mining operations are disruptive, rearranging the economic and social landscape of surrounding areas. How they influence people‚Äôs health is not always fully understood. Mortality studies that use only medical records have limitations.

‚ÄúIf you look at these mining areas from the perspective of health facility visits, what will come up often is things like cancer, HIV or other infectious diseases,‚Äù Lyatuu said.

Many deaths in Tanzania, unlike in countries like the U.S., happen outside the formal health care system. Family members may decide not to seek death certificates for dead loved ones, especially in rural areas where it can be time-consuming and costly.

Deaths records are necessarily incomplete.

So, the investigators went about gathering information the old-fashioned way: by talking to people. Verbal autopsies, where surveyors conduct structured interviews with family members and caregivers, are standard tools for gathering mortality statistics. They distill the narrations into data that trained physicians study to determine the cause of death.

For the Tanzanian study, surveyors tracked down fatalities in five wards around the mines, home to a total of 134,000 residents. In one year, they recorded nearly 350 deaths, of which 210 were men.

About a third of the working-age population in these wards was engaged in mining activities. But of the 186 people of working age who died, about half were miners, reflecting the higher risks miners faced compared to others in the community.

Most of the additional risk is from traffic-related injuries, and men were the most likely to die in such accidents.

Another study co-authored by Lyatuu shed light on community perceptions of mining operations in Tanzania, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Mozambique. The overall opinion was that mines harmed people, in particular, by polluting the environment, redefining livelihoods, and through societal changes. On the other hand, these projects also bolstered well-being through improved health care facilities, schools, water access and road construction.

This research highlighted the complex ways in which mining investments shape lives in and around the concessions.

However, data from the new study suggests that threats to life intensify in mining regions. Interventions are often narrowly focused on mining sites themselves and restricted in scope to things like mining gear, safety equipment, fire prevention measures and on-site road safety.

There is good reason for this. ‚ÄúMine-related road transport is a potentially high-risk on-site activity particularly due to factors including the size differential in vehicles, the changing nature of the road environment, and the 24/7 operating nature of the industry,‚Äù said David McTiernan, a transport safety expert at the Australian Road Research Board (ARRB), a private research body that has clients in Australia, Canada and South America.

But these dangers spill into the chaotic environs outside mining concessions, too. ‚ÄúIncreased off-site road transport activity can adversely impact mineworkers who regularly travel to and from the mine,‚Äù McTiernan told Mongabay in an email. ‚ÄúIt can also impact the local communities living along the roads connecting mines to their supporting industries such as camps, processing plants, and ports.‚Äù

Some problems are particular to developing countries like Tanzania, where mining sites often create islands of prosperity and infrastructure development that is not apace with the rest of the country. Many of the accidents documented in the new study involved motorcycles. The increase in population and rising incomes changes the mix of vehicles on the road and increases traffic volume. Road safety infrastructure like traffic lights, pedestrian crossings and barriers aren‚Äôt always in place, nor is awareness.

Francis Mbilima with the UNDP in Africa said his findings from mines in Zambia backed the idea that road safety is a major concern. ‚ÄúCommunity safety education is key,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt includes routine community sensitization roadshows and meetings. With the expansion of social media and community radios, this task is even easier.‚Äù

Mbilima described how at the Lumwana mine in Zambia, another Barrick Gold undertaking, fatalities from road incidents fell from 23 in 2012 to nine in 2015 owing mainly to community safety initiatives and investments by the mines. ‚ÄúThese are not one-off investments but better done within the broader national road safety standards, strategy and initiatives,‚Äù he said.

Barrick Gold did not respond to Mongabay‚Äôs attempts to seek comment about the findings from Tanzania.

Chris Nthite, a spokesperson for AngloGold Ashanti, said that the Geita Gold Mine has ‚Äúdeveloped and implemented several controls aimed at mitigating the hazard of road traffic accidents beyond the mine‚Äôs concession.‚Äù He added in an emailed response that these controls applied to the company‚Äôs own vehicle fleet and travel.

‚ÄúWhile GGM [Geita Gold Mining] co-operates with traffic authorities, it has no control over privately owned vehicles and employees traveling in their private capacity, which is the responsibility of local road-traffic authorities,‚Äù Nthite said.

The researchers shared their results with Tanzanian health authorities and held preliminary meetings with the mining companies. They plan to engage further with the companies to help design interventions at the two mining sites.

‚ÄúThis work should be considered a starting point, there is much to be learned from investigating the road accidents,‚Äù McTiernan said, adding that this includes probing where accidents happen, what kind of vehicles are involved, and who is killed.

Lyatuu echoed this need to examine road safety around the two mines. He said it was equally crucial for health impact assessments to be an integral part of how mining proposals are evaluated and that the definition of health and safety needs to be broader. ‚ÄúCompanies should be concerned about what happens beyond the mine gates,‚Äù he said.

Africa has a third of the global stock of metals and minerals and hosts around 700 active large-scale mining sites.
Researchers tracked deaths in communities that live in the shadow of Tanzania‚Äôs two largest gold mines, located in the north of the country.

465,"Experts point at flaws, NHAI says measures in place","Gurgaon: All ‚Äúspeed calming measures‚Äù and norms laid down by the Indian Road Congress (IRC) are in place on the U-turn flyover at IFFCO Chowk, the National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) officials said, even as road safety experts alleged that flyovers across NCR were planned keeping cars and not two-wheelers in mind. The safety of these structures have come under the spotlight on Sunday after two bikers died allegedly after they lost balance and toppled over the railing of the flyover 20 feet below.‚ÄúThis kind of incident has not happened (on the flyover) before and most likely occurred due to over speeding on the part of the commuter. From our end, all safety measures have been taken from the very first day. All speed calming measures are in place. We have also put signage alerting people to the speed limit of 40 kilometres per hour and have installed four rows of cat's eye where the curvature of the flyover begins so that the speed of a vehicle gets reduced automatically,‚Äù an NHAI official, who did not want to be identified, told TOI.Speed breakers, as per the NHAI, cannot be put on these elevated roads because there was a chance of vehicles jumping on these as well. Used by commuters travelling from MG Road and Huda City Centre towards Delhi and Sukhrali, the four-lane unidirectional flyover was constructed and opened to commuters in 2018.‚ÄúChevron boards that warn drivers of the curve ahead, and other relevant signage have been also installed at the curvature. The height of the boundary wall is also as per the IRC standards. Multiple safety audits of the structure have not shown any discrepancies,‚Äù the official added.Road safety experts with whom TOI spoke, however, said that such accidents were increasing not just in Gurgaon but across the NCR and the rest of the country. Multiple factors, they say, are responsible for this.‚ÄúOne of the issues is that these structures are normally designed for cars without taking two-wheelers into consideration. The U-turns and ramps on the interchanges are, however, also used by two-wheelers, which tend to then move at the same speed as a car but may not be necessarily safe for them. In addition, side crash protections are not taken into consideration, as a result of which commuters topple over because sufficient protection has not been given on the side of the structure and the sidewall has not been correctly designed,‚Äù Sewa Ram, associate professor and urban roads design expert at the School of Planning and Architecture, said.Ram recommended the usage of ‚Äúlow-height speed-calming measures‚Äù and designing ‚Äúforgiving roads‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhat forgiving roads do is that if there are three lanes, the outer lane, closest to the boundary wall, is painted in such a way as to alert the commuters not to drive on it. So, if by mistake a person‚Äôs vehicle starts skidding, the outer lane serves as a buffer, ensuring they will skid onto the lane but not fall down. The logic of forgiving measures is that if a person does make a mistake, they do not pay with their life,‚Äù Ram said.Rohit Baluja, director of the Institute of Road Traffic Education, meanwhile, attributed such mishaps to the absence of traffic engineering within the traffic management system and emphasised the need to follow the principles of a ‚Äúsafe systems approach‚Äù, which anticipates mistakes of commuters and implies taking measures to ensure that people do not die or sustain serious injuries.","Gurgaon: All ‚Äúspeed calming measures‚Äù and norms laid down by the Indian Road Congress (IRC) are in place on the U-turn flyover at IFFCO Chowk, the National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) officials said, even as road safety experts alleged that flyovers across NCR were planned keeping cars and not two-wheelers in mind.

466,India had most deaths in road accidents in 2019: Report,"A total of 151,113 people were killed in 480,652 road accidents across India in 2019, an average of 414 a day or 17 an hour, according to a report by the transport research wing of the ministry of road transport and highways.

India continued to have the most road fatalities in the world, followed by China, a distant second at 63,093 deaths in 2,12,846 road accidents in 2019, the report revealed. The United States of America (USA) reported the most road accidents at 2,211,439, and witnessed 37,461 deaths in 2019.

According to the report, speeding was the leading cause of deaths, while, in terms of vehicles, two-wheelers were involved in most road fatalities.

Across states, most road accidents were reported in Tamil Nadu (57,228), followed by Madhya Pradesh (50,669), Uttar Pradesh (42,572), Kerala (41,111) and Karnataka (40,658) accidents.

Maharashtra ranked sixth with 32,295 accidents, but saw the second-highest number of fatalities (12,788), after 22,655 in Uttar Pradesh.

Among cities, Delhi retained its first rank with 1,463 deaths, followed by Jaipur (1,283), Chennai (1,252) and Bengaluru (768).

Mumbai ranked ninth with 447 people being killed in road accidents in 2019.

The report stated that national and state highways, which account for just five per cent of the total roads in the country, saw the most deaths ‚Äî 61% of the total.

Two-wheelers were involved in 37% of the road deaths in the country, followed by pedestrians at 17% and light vehicles (comprising cars, jeeps and taxis) at 16%. A total of 56,136 people riding two-wheelers lost their lives, while 25,858 pedestrians died in 2019, stated the report.

The report stated that speeding accounted for most road accidents and deaths (ranging between 63% and 73% for accidents and between 62% and 70% for deaths) on all categories of national highways.

In 2019, like in previous years, young adults in the age group of 18-45 years accounted for nearly 69.3% of road accident deaths, while those in the age group of 18 ‚Äì 60 accounted for 84.3%.

Interestingly, it wasn‚Äôt curved roads that took the most lives ‚Äî 96,624 people lost their lives on straight roads, while curved roads saw 20,141 deaths.

‚ÄúTraditionally, for any accident or crash, the major causes could be ‚Äòdriver/human‚Äô, ‚Äòroad infrastructure‚Äô or ‚Äòvehicle-related factors‚Äô. Sometimes, there might be combinations of these factors which might lead to accidents. Among these major factors, ‚Äòdriver/human‚Äô-related factors or errors dominate,‚Äù said Nagendra R Velaga, associate professor (transportation systems engineering), department of civil engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay. Examples of such human/driver factors include ‚Äî rash driving, fatigue/sleep deprivation (particularly for long-haul truck drivers), speeding (due to certain reasons like time pressure or time constraints to reach the destination), on-board distractions (eg: using digital devices such as mobile phones while driving), driving under influence of alcohol and drugs, among other, said Velaga.

‚ÄúAdvanced technologies and artificial intelligence can control some human errors or driver factors (for example, camera-based speed-detection system). However, I strongly feel that it is the individual‚Äôs responsibility to respect their own life use required and appropriate precautionary measures (use seatbelt and helmet, follow traffic rules, and do not use phone while driving, avoid rash driving and drunk driving),‚Äù added Velaga

Former chairman of the Supreme Court (SC) committee on road safety, retired justice KS Radhakrishnan, said speeding is the major cause of accidents, especially on straight roads and highways, where control on speed is minimal. On curved roads, speeding is less, due to which accidents are less. ‚ÄúCondition of roads, traffic violations, drink and drive, among others, are also major contributors to high number of fatalities and accidents,‚Äù said Radhakrishnan.

Radhakrishnan, whose committee conducted 250 meetings with the government, national highways authority, state traffic departments and international agencies, to curb accidents, said, ‚ÄúThe meetings are heading in the right direction,‚Äù said Radhakrishnan. ‚ÄúThe fine in India is not a deterrent,‚Äù said Radhakrishnan adding, ‚ÄúHowever, the average person here will not be able to afford heavy fines. The government will just end up seizing licences.‚Äù

To bring down fatalities, Velaga said, ‚ÄúIn addition to national-level policies and legislation, regional or local-level control strategies or measures are required. Strong enforcement is also required.‚Äù

Velaga also said, ‚ÄúCausal and impact analysis of accidents/crashes is required for state, regional and local level. More focus on research related to human/driver factors may be needed to understand the exact of factors influencing the crashes and suitable remedial measures.‚Äù

Commenting on the report, Piyush Tewari, CEO and founder, SaveLIFE Foundation said, ‚ÄúThere is an urgent need for full implementation of the road safety provisions in the motor vehicle (amendment) Act 2019, including implementation of child safety provisions. Additionally, identifying risk factors specific to the safety of children and creating a plan to mitigate them should be prioritised by all state governments.‚Äù","India continued to have the most road fatalities in the world, followed by China, a distant second at 63,093 deaths in 2,12,846 road accidents in 2019, the report revealed.

468,"""Revamp the entire system of road repairs - Why wait for rains?""","The conditions of most roads in Bengaluru are as bad as they can possibly get. Potholes and slush have reduced the speed of all types of vehicles, increasing consumption of scarce fossil fuels like petrol, diesel etc., and also worsening atmospheric pollution. Citizens are losing patience.

Fed up with the deteriorating conditions of roads, citizens have been registering/highlighting their grievances on social media via creative means. Some have even taken matters into their own hands and have started fixing roads by themselves.

Yet the attitude of the executing authorities whose job it is to keep roads in good shape remains one of complacency and apathy. According to Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, Rs 20,000 crore have been spent on roads in the last five years.

Roads in Anjanappa Layout, Kothnur, have been dug up for around three years for various civic works. Pic credit: Pamela Bhutia

If we look at the genesis of this man-made problem, we find that:

Authorities are not conducting surveys of bad roads in a scientific manner

Finalisation of road repair schemes are interrupted by recommendations/demands of Corporators, MLAs, MPs for prioritising their areas for asphalting/repairs, black/white topping etc.

Incomplete details in tenders

Avoidable delay in issue of work orders

Contractors quoting low and uneconomical rates for bagging orders

Trading or outsourcing their works to third parties for a profit

Contractors defaulting/rescinding the contract and vanishing after drawing advances to avoid penal action

Unseasonal and unusually heavy rains or inclement weather due to climate change

Absence of officials during execution of works to ensure quality/quantity

Compromises in check measurements ‚Äì this is a grey area that higher-ups should look into properly

Citizens‚Äô negligence, inactiveness of Ward Committees/Area Sabhas/NGOs/area Welfare Associations in ensuring qualitative/quantitative execution of road works in their areas by conducting test checks with equipment available with the contractor. For example, temperature of bitumen mix, depth of laid road, compacting, camber, non-provision of proper shoulder drains with necessary slope to help rain water flow into storm water side-drains and non-clearance of clogged drains under main roads to avoid flooding, etc.

Discontinuance of laying of plastic-coated bitumen roads

Can these be avoided? Yes.

There is a school of thought that the system of awarding contracts for asphalting/black topping/repairs etc., is timed with the rainy season so that the roads get washed away during rains and public money has to be spent again to effect interim repairs before the time for annual repairs come again. It looks like a vicious circle. Adopting technology for cold asphalting‚Äîa method of spreading a chemical liquid into a pothole and spreading bitumen/asphalt and rolling it over‚Äîis not a remedy for this perennial problem.

All these problems and citizens complaints can be reduced if the entire process/system of calling for tenders etc. can be revised.

Following suggestions may be adopted for arresting systemic failures in planning and execution of road maintenance in accordance with the specifications prescribed under the Indian Roads Congress.

Time frame Activity April to June Municipal/local body budget exercise is completed. Depending upon the size of the budget, plan of action for road maintenance may be placed before the concerned committee. July Undertake physical verification of roads that need to be white-topped/ repaired/relaid/replaced with substitutes or to be just maintained as an annual exercise, and classify them into ABC category. Prescribe strict time schedules for concerned officials and elected representatives to submit their recommendations. August Complete the task of verification, finalise packages with equitable distribution of works to different classes of registered contractors on a pro-rata basis of population. Avoid splitting of contracts, to ensure transparency and accountability. September Draw up draft tender documents; float tenders, initiate and finalise the process of negotiations and number of packages. Due diligence with checks and balances must be exercised while accepting tenders from blacklisted contractors who have a clever way of bagging plum contracts with benami tenders or a coterie of contractors who bag the contracts and get work done by subcontracting the work. With e-tendering in place, the tendering process has been made easy, economical and fast. September-October Issue work orders to successful bidders and ensure that they are fully equipped with necessary machineries/implements/materials and labor. By the time this is completed, there will be enough solar light for drying up the roads for dusting, etc. November/December/ January Ensure that works are completed in strict compliance with terms and conditions of award of contract as per tendered rates.

Watch out for time/cost overruns and reasons thereof, initiate immediate action either to issue notice for delay in completion of works by contractors or to rescind the contract and/or appropriate the earnest money deposits. Also, initiate penal clauses for recovery of expenditure incurred in connection with re-tendering/cost of overrun, etc. February Undertake inspection of works, conduct quality control checks, obtain actual measurements, audit, finalise bills and make payments. March Before March 31st each year, conduct a brainstorming session with officials, contractors and NGOs about the causes for non-completion of works, initiate short re-tendering, complete the works. And after due diligence, make final payments of bills to avoid surrender of budget grants due to non-utilisation.

This suggested revised schedule for undertaking qualitative/quantitative road works may solve a number of problems currently faced by authorities, lessen inconveniences to road users and avoid accidents.

If this exercise is undertaken, public money being spent ‚Äòwill not go down the drain‚Äô. Funds will be utilised for the purpose for which they were sanctioned; there will be no surrender of unutilised grants under various works.

Also, scams pertaining to year-end withdrawal of funds and depositing them in private banks in violation of financial rules and regulations, and earning audit comments thereon, may be avoided.

The state government also demanded that the Centre take up works of Madurai Western Ring Road, Coimbatore Half Ring Road and Coimbatore-Sathyamangalam Road at 6,600 crore.The roads that the state government wants to be converted to NHs are Tiruvannamalai-Kallakurichi (65km), Vallioor-Tiruchendur (70km), Kollegal-Hanur-MM Hills-Palar Road-TN border extended up to Mettur (30km), Palani-Dharapuram (31km), Arcot-Tindivanam (91km), Mettupalayam-Bhavani (98km), Avinashi-Mettupalayam (38km) and Bhavani-Karur (77km). ‚ÄúThe present condition of these roads needs immediate repairs/improvements to cater to the present day-to-day traffic. The roads are most important, connecting significant pilgrimage centres such as Tiruvannamalai, Tiruchendur and Palani and many trade and tourism centres. Upon upgradation, Kallakurichi-Tiruvannamalai and Arcot-Tindivanam roads will serve as the shortest routes to important pilgrimage centre Tirupathi/Tirumala,‚Äù minister E V Velu said in a representation to Union minister Nitin Gadkari.The 30-km-long Madurai Western Ring Road will connect AIIMS, Madurai-Cochin Road and Kodai Road, link the integrated Madurai bus stand at Mattuthavani and central vegetable and flower market with NH44 (Srinagar-Kanyakumari Road). The project cost is 1,200 crore. The 3,480 crore Half Ring Road for Coimbatore was approved by the Centre in March 2018. It can be taken up in two phases ‚Äì from Karanampettai to Periyanayakkanpalayam and Madukkarai to Karanampettai.

The stretch from Coimbatore to Sathyamangalam that leads to Karnataka through Dhimbam hill is two-lane with many curves. The NHAI has proposed four-laning of Coimbatore-Sathyamangalam and two-laning of Sathyamangalam-inter-state border for 90km. ‚ÄúThe ministry may consider upgrading the inter-state connecting road for safer traffic flow in the ghat section and decongest traffic,‚Äù the minister said. The project cost, including land acquisition, is 1,920 crore.The state government also took up with the ministry the need to widen eight bypasses on the Salem-Ulundurpet section of NH-68 to four-lane immediately. Statistics reveal that the existence of two-lane bypasses within the four-lane highway causes frequent road accidents and fatalities. ‚ÄúAccidents occur frequently on these bypass locations, where the transition from two-lane to four lane and four-lane to two-lane occurs at the junction points of these bypasses,‚Äù Velu said. Between April 2016 and July 2021, 715 accidents took place, resulting in 169 fatalities and 309 major injuries.

471,Watch | All about road accidents in India,"A video explainer on India's battle with road accidents in numbers

Road accidents are the leading cause of death among people in the 5-29 age-group worldwide according to a World Health Organisation report.

More than 1.35 million lives are lost each year and 50 million people sustain injuries. Globally, road accidents are the tenth leading cause of death.

India accounts for about 5 lakh road accidents annually, one of the highest in the world, in which about 1.5 lakh people die and another 3 lakh become crippled.

Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways V.K. Singh has said that around 71% of 4.49 lakh road accidents in India in 2019 were due to over speeding.

According to experts, the main causes of road accidents in India are rapid urbanisation, poor safety, lack of enforcement, distracted drivers, influence of drugs or alcohol, speeding and a failure to wear seat-belts or helmets.

There has been a 10% reduction in the number of deaths caused due to accidents in the country since the passage of the amended Motor Vehicles Act, said Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari.

He said the government has pledged to reduce 50% accidents in the next five years, and India is a signatory to this at the World Safety Conference held in Sweden recently.

Among various steps being taken to reduce accidents, the government proposes to open 1,000 driving schools in the country.

In 2020, the government launched a central accident database management system known as the Integrated Road Accident Database that will help in analysing causes of road crashes and in devising safety interventions to reduce such accidents in the country.","A video explainer on India's battle with road accidents in numbersRoad accidents are the leading cause of death among people in the 5-29 age-group worldwide according to a World Health Organisation report.

472,Road deaths in 2020 was the lowest in 11 years,"NEW DELHI: Road accidents claimed around 1.32 lakh lives in 2020, which is the lowest in the past 11 years. The earlier lowest was 1.26 lakh in 2009.The number of road accidents also fell to 3.66 lakh during last year, which was lowest in the past 20 years. The sharp decline in road deaths and crashes was primarily because of restriction on movement of vehicles during to Covid-induced lockdown across the country. In 2019, around 1.51 lakh lives were lost in road crashes in India.Replying to a question in the Lok Sabha, transport minister Nitin Gadkari quoted the reduction in deaths and said his ministry has formulated a multi-pronged strategy to address the issue of road safety based on education, engineering (of roads and vehicles), enforcement and emergency care.The road fatalities had witnessed sharpest decline in the April-June quarter of 2020 calendar year when 20,732 persons were killed compared to 41,032 during the same period in 2019. Most parts of the country were under lockdown during this period. ‚ÄúThis simply shows why we must not treat road crashes as a fate.

473,"Road accidents, deaths drop by over 20% in 2020 partly due to Covid-19: Gadkari","India has recorded a significant drop in road crashes and deaths in the first three quarters of calendar 2020 against same time in 2019. This is partly due to COVID-19 pandemic-prompted lockdowns and people voluntarily not venturing out to prevent transmission.

""India has seen a 26.48 per cent reduction in road accidents and a 22 per cent drop in deaths in 2020 against 2019‚Ä¶. COVID-19 has contributed to this reduction in accidents and deaths,"" Nitin Gadkari, Minister for Road Transport and Highways, said in a road safety conference.

Road Ministry sources later said the data refers to January to September 2020 against same-period 2019.

India, which loses almost 1.5 lakh lives every year on account of road accidents, is revising its target to drop the extent of road fatalities by half by 2025 or earlier, instead of the earlier target of 2030, said Gadkari. He cited Tamil Nadu's example recording a continuous drop in road accidents and deaths in the last three-four years.

""It's okay to miss road construction target, but we should try and meet the target of saving lives from road accidents and deaths earlier‚Ä¶,"" said Gadkari, pointing out that targeting reduction by half means seeing 75,000 deaths every year till 2030.

Reasons for drop

Other contributors to a drop in road crashes include India strengthening road safety measures like increasing penalties for traffic accidents; fixing and redesigning 'blackspots' or spaces identified with large accidents where road design could be changed; bringing in vehicle-safety parameters among others.

States like Tamil Nadu and some highway developers have lowered deaths and accidents through focused interventions like CCTVs surveillance, electronic-challans, and making road safety.

Tamil Nadu has seen fatalities from road accidents drop to 7,278 (for 11 months up to November) in 2020, against 17,218 deaths in 2016; road accidents have dropped to 40,725 (in 11 months of 2020) against 71,431 in 2016; and grievous injuries were down to 3,205 (11 months, 2020) against 82,163 in 2016.

According to Maj Gen (Retd) Pawan Anand, Secretary-General, Highway Operators' Association of India (HOAI), a body of highway operators and maintainers, the road developers have taken specific interventions like smoothening the sharper curves on highways and seen a significant drop in crashes. More lighting on several highways also resulted in a decline in accidents, said Anand. One of the national highway stretches -- Dharmavaram-Rajahmundri -- saw a 48 per cent drop in deaths and 20 per cent drop in crashes in three years of 2015-2018.

In another move, Uber, along with Lenskart, will provide free or subsidised spectacles to drivers, it was announced.

All-round awareness

Rajnath Singh, Defence Minister, called for all-round awareness to lower accidents, adding that he had asked his driver to speed up that resulted in an accident. Singh said that the Covid-19 pandemic has led to over 1.5 lakh deaths in about 11 months; road accidents result in as many deaths every year, indicating the scale of the challenge.","""India has seen a 26.48 per cent reduction in road accidents and a 22 per cent drop in deaths in 2020 against 2019‚Ä¶.

474,Road accident scenario more 'dangerous' than Covid in India: Gadkari,"NEW DELHI: Terming road accident scenario in India more ""dangerous than COVID-19 pandemic"", Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday said there could be a saving of Rs 90 lakh per person by preventing deaths and reducing injuries to minor ones in such incidents.The minister stressed that the accident cost as a tremendous burden to society and the nation and the estimated cost of a death in a road accident is around Rs 91.16 lakh.Releasing the World Bank report on 'Traffic Crash Injuries And Disabilities: The Burden on India Society', prepared in association with Save Life Foundation, Road Transport , Highways and MSMEs Minister Gadkari said in this alarming scenario his ministry will formulate policies to protect the interest of the poor and embark on several reformative steps.India accounts for the highest number of road accidents globally, with 1.5 lakh people being killed and more than 4.5 lakh crippled annually in 4.5 lakh road accidents with losses amounting to 3.14 per cent of the GDP.""For Government, each life is precious whether that is from poor or rich family, urban or rural area, male or female and at any level of society. The situation is alarming... there are more deaths than in COVID-19...It is more dangerous than COVID-19,"" Gadkari said terming the World Bank report an eye-opener.In India cost per seriously injured person comes at Rs 3.64 lakh while cost per minor injured person stands at Rs 77, 938 and the cost per death is estimated at Rs 91.16 lakh, he said.""So death cost is 100 times more than injury cost. It shows that if we succeed in preventing deaths in a road accident and restrict the life of accident victims to minor injuries only, we can save around Rs 90 lakh per person,"" the minister said addressing the event.""We needed to change law and make special policies. Accident cost as a tremendous burden to society and nation. There are lots of lapses in the legal system, police system. We need to protect the poor,"" he said adding that policy interventions are on the anvil apart from a number of steps, already initiated by his ministry.Around 70 per cent of deaths are in the working-age group of 18 to 45 years old while India accounts for 415 deaths per day in road accidents.Emphasising road safety audits, besides audit of detailed project reports, engineering plans and schemes pertaining to the injured, the minister said various audits can correct deficiencies causing accidents.Earlier, 40,000 km of highways have been brought under auditing.The minister said IITs and engineering colleges could take up highway stretches for road safety audit with some financial aid while third-party road safety audits will help in finding engineering faults and correcting them.Emphasising that his ministry was one such ministry which did not believe in protecting the wrong-doers and was transparent, the minister said there is a need that DPRs should be proof-checked and revised by competent authorities, third-party agencies, and educational institutions before implementation.He urged states to replicate Tamil Nadu model which could reduce road accidents by 38 per cent and deaths by 54 per cent and added 78 per cent of road accident deaths are of two-wheeler riders, bicyclists and pedestrians and protection and safety of these vulnerable road user groups is the foremost priority of the Centre.Gadkari further said the chairman of the National Road Safety Council will be announced soon as this body will be responsible for collecting accident data and suggesting measures to further reduce road accidents.Stressing that 70 per cent of accident deaths In India are due to over-speeding, the minister said fitness check of all vehicles has been mandated through Automated Vehicle Inspection and Certification (I&C) centres.Gadkari also said it is essential that automobile manufacturers should further enhance safety features.Broadly, the Report says that road accidents are a tremendous burden to society and the nation and states and reducing accident deaths and injuries can boost income growth and large welfare gains can be achieved from proven cost-effective road safety interventions.The minister said road accident deaths and injuries strike down prime working-age adults in low and middle-income countries and added that accidents are a public health issue and challenge in countries like India.Gadkari said the government is working with the World Bank on various projects, one of which is to streamline the road crash database that is iRAD.Pointing out that one of the key findings of the report is that the number of accident deaths is double in poor families as compared to rich ones, he said it is very important to have a streamlined and robust and accessible legal, insurance and healthcare ecosystem.The minister said that recommendations of the report on the safety of vulnerable road users, cashless treatment, improvement of civic and health infrastructures, penetration and compensation mechanism of insurance, post-crash response ecosystem and integration of stake-holders would help in revising the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act 2019 and Motor Vehicle rules.The World Bank report comes even as the country is observing an extended first-ever ‚ÄúRoad Safety Month‚Äù currently to build awareness of road safety.","""For Government, each life is precious whether that is from poor or rich family, urban or rural area, male or female and at any level of society.

475,India aims to reduce road accidents by 50 per cent before 2024. Here's the plan,"Union minister Nitin Gadkari has assured that road accident cases in India will go go down by about 50 per cent in the next three years. He has set the target for his Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) to reduce the number of road accidents before 2024 by improving quality of roads as well as safety measures.

Nitin Gadkari's remarks come months after he said that he hopes reduction in deaths in road accidents to go down by 50% before 2025. He had also said that if ""we keep waiting till 2030, then at least 6-7 lakh people will die more due to road accidents"".

Addressing a virtual event organised by industry body Ficci, Nitin Gadkari said, ""Around 1.5 lakh persons die due to road accidents (every year)... My internal target is before 2024, we will reduce deaths and accidents by 50 per cent.""

Currently, a little over 400 people die every day in India due to road accidents. India also records around 1.5 lakh deaths in five lakh road crashes annually. Nitin Gadkari had listed this record as one of the biggest failures of his ministry in the last seven years.

Gadkari laid emphasis on road quality and safety measures on Indian roads to bring down the figures. His ministry is actively working to reduce black spots from Indian roads. Gadkari pointed out that around 50 per cent of road accidents are due to road engineering problems.

Gadkari said his ministry is striving hard to reduce road accident deaths by restructuring and strengthening four 'Es' of road safety -- Engineering (including road and automobile engineering), Economy, Enforcement and Education.

Gadkari also said that insurance companies need to cooperate more with respect to road safety activities to help the ministry to bring down casualties in road crashes. ""Insurance companies are direct beneficiaries of a saved life. Hence, they can extend their cooperation for various road safety activities... but the cooperation from the insurance companies is very negligible, and cooperation from government insurance companies is zero,"" he said.

Gadkari said that there is a shortage of 22 lakh drivers across the country. This has prompted the government to plan 2,000 driving schools, especially in backward districts.","Similar BikesNitin Gadkari's remarks come months after he said that he hopes reduction in deaths in road accidents to go down by 50% before 2025.

479,Common myths & underlying data behind road accidents in India,"While things seem very bleak at this moment, historical data puts this in an entirely different light.

BHPian Stribog recently shared this with other enthusiasts.

There are many preconceived ""notions"" that many of us have on road accidents. A few I see often in many threads in this forum itself:

2-wheelers are inherently unsafe

The converse, cars are safer

Trucks and buses are doom-bringers

And a lot more.

Well, let us look at the numbers behind accidents in India. Morbid yes, but relevant also IMO. MoRTH publishes data annually (like pretty much all central govt. bureaus like say NCRB) which can be a treasure trove for those who like number crunching.

At the outset though, there is no escaping the fact that Indian roads are fatal in absolute numbers.

Some Meta stats - All data are from the Sept report, covering 2019-20 (no report has been published thus far this year, but would be interesting to see the impact COVID had on accidents)

India, ranks 1st in the number of road accident deaths across the 199 countries reported in the World Road Statistics, 2018 followed by China and US. As per the WHO Global Report on Road Safety 2018, India accounts for almost 11% of the accident related deaths in the World A total of 4,49,002 road accidents have been reported by States and Union Territories (UTs) in the calendar year 2019, claiming 1,51,113 lives and causing injuries to 4,51,361 persons. Normalised to population, you have. A 0.05% chance of being involved in an accident with a 0.01% chance of it being fatal. In percentage terms, in 2019, the number of accidents have decreased by 3.86 percent, persons killed has decreased by 0.20% and injuries have decreased by 3.85 percent over that of the previous year i.e. 2018. Road accident severity measured by the number of persons killed per 100 accidents has seen an increase of 1.3 percentage points in 2019 over the previous year National Highways & State Highways which account for about 5% of the total road length accounts for a disproportionately large share of accident related deaths of 61%. Other Roads which constitute about 95 % of the total road length were responsible for the balance 39% deaths respectively Over-speeding accounts for the maximum share of road accident and road accident deaths (ranging between 63% and 73% for accidents and between 62% and 70% for road accident deaths) on all the categories of National Highways and thus follows the trend seen on all India basis. To be safe (as much as possible) 4+5 should be combined. Stick to speed limits on NH & SH, follow defensive driving and statistically chances of your being involved in an accident will drop significantly. The share of males in number of total accident deaths was 86% while the share of females hovered around 14% in 2019. This reflects both the number of male drivers (though we don't have official data on the number / % of female drivers) and IMO aggressive driving by men.

Historical Perspective:

While things seem very bleak at this moment, historical data puts this in an entirely different light. There has been a drastic reduction in accidents, fatalities and injuries starting 1970 on though the number of vehicles on the road has exploded.

Some top-line numbers:

1970 - Vehicle Density (VD) 1.18 (number of vehicles / km of road), Fatality Rate (FR) 103.5 (this is the number of fatal accidents per 10,000 pop)

1980 - VD 3.03, FR 53.1

1990 - VD 9.65, FR 28.3

2000 - VD 14.73, FR 16.2

While our vehicle density went up 4.5X from 1980 to 2000, our FR dropped by 70%

2010 - VD 27.88, FR 10.5

2018 - VD 39.78, FR 6.2 (data for 2019 not available when this report was published)

From 2010-18, our VD went up by 42%, but our FR dropped by 40%.

If these values are projected into the future, our accident and FR might just meet the Stockholm commitment of halving road accidents and fatalities by 2030.

Coming up in part 2, would be vehicle-wise accident and fatality rates. Let us see if the urban legends hold up or remain that, urban legends.

Here's what BHPian RedTerrano had to say on the matter:

I cannot help but wonder, how the authorities arrived at the conclusion that over speeding caused accidents leading to death. How many speed traps or radar guns have been deployed on the highways? Is any data available for this? How about non-fatal accidents on the highways? How many caused due to lack of lane demarcation, lack or road signs, unpainted speed breakers, road blockages set up by local RTA (without proper signage or reflectors)? Any data available on this? Also, is there any data available for German autobahns where there is no speed limit? How do those fatalities fare as compared to Indian highways?

Here's what BHPian PearlJam had to say on the matter:

Why do you think this is a preconceived notion? Rest of the things being the same, even a gentle hit to a two wheeler traveling at 30 KMPH could cause the rider to fall. Or, there could be a small oil patch on the road that causes the rider to skid and fall. They could get crushed by other vehicles. They could have head injuries if the helmet was improper. They could be affected by sudden winds. A car driver would most likely remain safe, even in a Maruti 800, in the same situation. This is just one example. I'm not even talking of any safety equipment. You have given a few numbers that some show absolute numbers and a few percentages. This is no way ""concludes"" your points (1) and (2). For example, there are no numbers on 2 wheelers vs cars on our roads. There are no rough average numbers on the distances travelled (or time spent on the road) by 2 wheelers vs cars. There are no numbers on whether they drive/ride in the cities or on the highways. There are no numbers on the average speeds. There is no mention of day/night driving/riding. I see the numbers as meaningless and incomplete. Am I missing something here?

Check out BHPian comments for more insights and information.","There are many preconceived ""notions"" that many of us have on road accidents.

480,Tamil Nadu: 3 killed in bus-lorry collision near Palani,"Three people were killed and around 15 injured in a collision between a Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation bus and a lorry near Thalayam in Palani on Friday morning. The bus was on its way to Coimbatore from Palani while the lorry had unloaded bricks near Coimbatore and was on its way to Palani.

According to the officials from the Dindigul SP office, three people were travelling in the lorry while the bus had 30 passengers, besides the driver and his associate. The accident happened at 2:40 am.

The deceased have been identified as Manikandan Prabhu (30), Ukkarapandi (24), Murugan (38).

The injured have been admitted to Palani Government Hospital. According to reports, the lorry driver seems to have fallen asleep and lost control of the vehicle. The Saminathapuram police have registered a case and are carrying out further investigation, an official said.

Saminathapuram Inspector Senthil said a case has been registered against lorry driver Rajesh under Sections 279, 337, 304 (A) of the IPC. ‚ÄúThe driver has also sustained injuries on his head and he is currently in the ICU. Further action will be initiated once he is discharged from the hospital,‚Äù he said.

Addressing the reporters, Dindigul SP VR Srinivasan said steps will be taken to avoid such accidents in the future. He said check-posts and highway patrol officials have been instructed to check on the lorry drivers if they are sleepy, and provide them with water, etc.","Three people were killed and around 15 injured in a collision between a Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation bus and a lorry near Thalayam in Palani on Friday morning.

481,"In India, six two-wheeler riders die every hour in road accidents","As two-wheelers become more popular in the absence of public transport, the number of road accidents involving these is also growing. More than a third (37%) of those killed in road accidents in 2019 were two-wheeler riders, noted a Ministry of Road Transport and Highways‚Äô report published in October this year.

More crashes and deaths are resulting from faulty licensing laws, no training, poor roads and unsafe helmets. Just correct helmet use could reduce the risk of fatal injuries by 42% and head injuries by 69%, a World Health Organization report said.

India needs stricter licensing laws and must ensure the use of proper helmets through effective communication and fines, experts told IndiaSpend. Mandatory and proper training for riding and handling two-wheelers is a must, as is an overall improvement in road infrastructure. Also, India must bolster public transport in order to reduce traffic.

Bike sales grow with income

As the gross national income per capita rises, the number of two-wheelers also increases. The poorer the country, the higher the growth, according to The United Nations Motorcycle Helmet Study published in 2016. An exponential, growth in a country‚Äôs two-wheeler fleet might result in a rapid increase in the number of motorcycle crashes.

India witnessed a rapid growth in per capita incomes in the last decade, which also led to people buying more vehicles ‚Äì particularly two-wheelers ‚Äì according to a study by the Institute for Social and Economic Change, Bangalore. India‚Äôs per capita income grew by 28% between 2013 and 2017 while two-wheeler registrations increased by 46% (compared to 44% overall new vehicle registrations) over the same period.

Last year, 2.12 crore two-wheelers were sold in India and the annual sales are projected to reach 2.66 crore units by 2025 at 2.6% growth rate, according to UnivDatos .

Alongside the increase in income and the subsequent rise in the number of vehicles, India also witnessed concrete or tarred surface road growth of 4.18% from 1951-2018 . However, all this has not been accompanied by a corresponding improvement in regulation and regulatory infrastructure necessary to protect and educate vulnerable road users, pointed out experts.

There is barely any education on road safety in India, said Vir Nakai, 41, a Mumbai-based motorcyclist and brand strategist for bike manufacturers.

‚ÄúSafety is not high on our agenda... whether it is issuing driving licences or formulating and enforcing traffic rules,‚Äù said Nakai, who has been riding motorcycles across the country for over two decades. ‚ÄúThat is the main reason why we have to deal with hazards like parked vehicles on main roads, people riding and driving on the wrong side, little regard for traffic lights and complete lack of lane discipline. Motorcyclists are a small thing on the road and no one cares about them.‚Äù

Together, two-wheelers and pedestrians account for 54% of accident-related deaths in India and are the most vulnerable category in line with global trends, according to the ministry report . While 37% of road accident deaths (56,136) ‚Äì or six every hour, on average ‚Äì involved two-wheelers, pedestrians made up 17% and cyclists 3%. There were 449,002 road accidents leading to 151,113 deaths, making Indian roads the deadliest in the world, the report noted. India accounts for 11% of the global road accident fatalities.

Mobility and motorcycles

Motorcycles and scooters, given their price-point and availability, are a convenient alternative to the inadequate public transport that exists outside of the big cities, said Nakai. The average commute time for surveyed two-wheeler riders in Pune was just about 30 minutes while commuting by public transport typically took much longer, found a 2014 research by World Resources Institute .

‚ÄúScooters or two-wheelers are seen more as family vehicles in rural and semi-urban areas,‚Äù said Bhargab Maitra, a professor of infrastructure design at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. ‚ÄúYou will see that bike sales are higher in these areas but enforcement of traffic laws is a lot more lax.‚Äù

‚ÄúMost places of work are in cities while the workers tend to stay in the suburbs as housing prices within the city are too high for many to afford,‚Äù said Tej Prakash Sinha, head of emergency medicine of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.

While cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata have metro and local train services and others such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai are developing their metro coverage, most of India does not have proper public transport services. Hence people are forced to travel long distances daily and bikes make the commute faster and easier, he added.

Poor licensing laws, little training

Vehicles driven by untrained and unqualified drivers are a serious traffic hazard. Road accidents involving drivers without a valid driving license increased from 37,585 in 2018 to 44,358 in 2019, an increase of 18%, and accounted for 9.9% of the total accidents, the transport ministry data showed.

‚ÄúAt least, car drivers do go through some level of training before they are issued a driving license in India,‚Äù said Piyush Tewari, founder of SaveLIFE Foundation . ‚ÄúThis is a missing factor for many two-wheeler riders. There is almost negligible training that people undergo in terms of crash prevention, road safety rules... they just learn how to operate the bike. So that is a major overall contributor to crashes.‚Äù

The ministry data also revealed that about 72% of road accidents involved drivers holding a valid driver license. Of 317 victims of traumatic brain injury from road accidents studied for a 2018 AIIMS paper , only two-thirds were carrying a ‚Äúformal driving license‚Äù; only one had a learner‚Äôs license.

The driving license for two-wheelers is almost a joke, said Nakai.

‚ÄúI took a written test for my driving licence and then drove in a car for the road test,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúAfter finishing my drive, the person assessing me noticed I had applied for both two-wheelers and cars. When I said I would drop off the car and come back with a bike in a few minutes, he said, ‚ÄòSince you can drive a car, you would know how to ride a motorcycle.‚Äô That was how it was.‚Äù

Given the kind of motorcycles available in the market now, such oversight in granting licences is dangerous. ‚ÄúMost riders in India do not have sufficient training to handle motorcycles like a KTM-390 (a powerful and very fast motorcycle) or other such bikes,‚Äù added Nakai. ‚ÄúThe skills needed to handle and ride these bigger bikes are very different from riding a basic motorcycle. One needs to undergo special training to be able to ride them safely. But, in India, if you have a driving license, it is a blanket permit to ride anything from a scooty to a Hayabusa [superbike] and here everybody gets a two-wheeler license.‚Äù

In contrast, Singapore has multi-tiered license categories and minimum age requirements corresponding to the power of the bikes. A Grade 1 license for 100cc bikes is issued at 18 years of age, and only after more training and at the age of 19 years one can apply for a Grade 2 for 150-200cc two-wheelers and a Grade 3 license for superbikes is issued at the age of 20, said Tewari. ‚ÄúAt the moment, a 19-year-old in India could get a learner‚Äôs license and drive a superbike, which is almost like a weapon in the hands of untrained youngsters,‚Äù he said.

Road infrastructure and vehicle design

Suchi Vora, 34, an architect in Pune, has been riding two-wheelers since she was 16 even though she started learning how to ride one when she was a 13-year-old like many of her peers did at the time in her hometown. The roads on which she started riding in the 1990s have come a long way and are much improved today, she said.

‚ÄúThe city‚Äôs road and infrastructure have advanced tremendously from the time I first started riding but they have become more dangerous too,‚Äù said Vora. ‚ÄúThe city roads are a patchwork at best. They are uneven and riddled with potholes, which are practically deathtraps. There are more people speeding on our streets and the traffic has become a lot worse compared to the improvement in city roads. In the outskirts, the roads are still pretty bad. I do not feel safe taking my scooty to far away places‚Ä¶ I use a car. There is always someone coming from the wrong side or jumping signals. You never know what could hit you if you switch off even for a minute.‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo-wheelers are becoming more fuel efficient and hence their popularity is high in both rural and urban areas,‚Äù said Maitra of IIT. ‚ÄúThe road infrastructure is growing as well but it is not keeping pace with the growing number of vehicles and also the quality of the road infrastructure is not up to the mark.‚Äù

On national highways, on average, driving on the wrong side of the road caused 5.2% and drunken driving led to 3.7% of the accidents, according to the government report.

‚ÄúOur road infrastructure is not very forgiving, one violation could lead to an accident,‚Äù added Maitra. ‚ÄúThis is especially true in the case of two-wheeler drivers. Even though cars also violate rules, they are at least protected by the vehicle in some ways.‚Äù

While road and infrastructure development has been sluggish, two-wheelers have evolved at a much faster pace and the current vehicles available in India are far more efficient, powerful and speedier than the scooters that the majority used to ride in the 1990s, experts and bikers told IndiaSpend. ‚ÄúWhile the scooters and bikes of the 1990s used to struggle to accelerate, motorcycles available in India today have become a lot faster,‚Äù said Nakai. ‚ÄúTwo-wheeler development has far outpaced infrastructure development in our country.‚Äù

This is where road and vehicle design clash. The current speed limit in the country is 80 km/h on a four-lane highway. Even the entry-level 100cc motorcycles hit speeds of 80 km/h without much trouble.

Overspeeding caused, on average, 71.6% of all road accidents on national highways, the Central report said. If the speed limit on our roads is reduced to about 55 km/h -57 km/h, we could save around 30% to 37% lives, according to an advisor to the WHO, as IndiaSpend reported .

Helmets and trauma injury

Almost everyone in India who has ridden a bike or scooter has done so without a helmet at least once in their lives, noted Nakai. ‚ÄúA huge number of bikers do not wear a helmet and among those who wear one, a lot of the helmets are of poor quality,‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúAgain, this is because of our attitude towards safety. We do not take safety seriously.‚Äù Not wearing helmets resulted in deaths of 44,666 (30,148 drivers and 14,518 pillions) or 29.82% of total road accident fatalities during 2019, according to the ministry data .

Correct helmet use can lead to a 42% reduction in the risk of fatal injuries and a 69% reduction in the risk of head injuries according to the WHO . ‚ÄúOftentimes, we have seen that it [death] is because of either not wearing a helmet or wearing a very poor quality helmet,‚Äù said Tewari. ‚ÄúAnother challenge is implementing the helmet rule and availability of affordable and quality helmets right now.‚Äù

483,India saw 13% decline in fatal road accidents in 2020: Nitin Gadkari informs Parliament,"Representational image

Around 3,66,138 road accidents took place in India in 2020, causing 1,31,714 deaths. The figure was around 13 percent lower than the corresponding number for 2019, which saw 1,51,113 deaths due to road accidents in India, Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari said in a written response in Lok Sabha on August 5.

One must note here, one of the reasons behind the sharp decrease in the number of road accidents in 2020 was partially due to the coronavirus pandemic outbreak, which forced the entire nation into months of strict lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. During this time, the movement of vehicles -- commercial and private -- was highly regulated.

Giving further details on road accidents in India, the Road Transport Minister informed the Lok Sabha that Tamil Nadu recorded the highest number of road accidents followed by West Bengal and Karnataka.

He added that road accidents in India occur mainly due to speeding, drunken driving, driving on the wrong side, lane indiscipline, use of mobile phones while driving, mechanical defect, faulty vehicle, bad roads, bad weather, and lack of knowledge on road signage.

Gadkari pointed out that now road safety has been made an integral part of road design at the planning stage.

""The ministry has delegated powers to regional officers of MoRTH for technical approval of the detailed estimates for rectification of identified road accident black spots,"" he said.

While addressing the issue, Gadkari also said that his ministry has devised a multi-pronged strategy to address the road safety issues. The strategy will focus on education, road engineering, vehicle engineering, enforcement, and emergency care.

To minimise the number of road accidents, the Government of India has also imposed stricter punitive measures for violations of traffic rules under the new amended Motor Vehicles Act.","Representational imageAround 3,66,138 road accidents took place in India in 2020, causing 1,31,714 deaths.

484,Why India's new traffic law failed to curb road accidents,"Just over a year ago, dramatic traffic penalties under the amended Motor Vehicles Act made headlines across the country. The centre claimed the fines would curb road accidents. But latest government data show the reality was mixed and the fear of the law may have fizzled out quite soon.

A total of 154,732 people died on Indian roads in 437,396 accidents last year, the National Crime Records Bureau‚Äôs (NCRB‚Äôs) latest update shows. Around 139,000 of these accidents took place after the increased penalties kicked in on 1 September, 2019. Compared to the same period in 2018, this was a 4% drop.

But a closer look shows the decline was the sharpest (7.5%) in September, and began tapering October onward. A year-on-year comparison adjusts for seasonal effects since September anyway sees the fewest road accidents every year.





The NCRB gets the data on accidents and accidental deaths from state police bureaus. Due to underreporting, actual death counts could be 47-63% higher than official data, according to IIT Delhi‚Äôs Transportation Research and Injury Prevention Programme.

The World Health Organization‚Äôs estimate of accident deaths in India in 2016 was two times the government tally. This analysis focuses largely on accidents in cities, where reporting is typically better.

‚ÄúWhen the new law was announced, a lot of people suddenly started behaving on the road, such as stopping much before the zebra crossing and so on,"" said Piyush Tewari, chief executive officer of road safety nonprofit SaveLIFE Foundation. But within weeks, the deterrence factor got lost, and the situation has ‚Äúgone back to what it was"", he said.

Kamal Soi, a member of the centre‚Äôs National Road Safety Council, agreed the impact fizzled out ‚Äúa little"" and said enforcement agencies needed to keep up the momentum. Results can be expected only if the rules are enforced rigorously for at least 18 months, he said.

Gaps in implementation varied by state. Some of the most accident-prone cities and states reported a more sustained decline September onwards, but others did not. Due to public anger and political concerns, some states‚Äîeven those ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party‚Äîdecided to delay or reduce the fines. For instance, Gujarat‚Äôs penalties are lower than the centrally mandated ones, and Odisha implemented them only in March 2020.

States have to ‚Äúenforce the rules not for the central government, but for their own citizens"", Soi said. ‚ÄúStates that are not applying it are risking lives,"" he added.





Deaths due to dangerous driving and overspeeding‚Äîthe biggest killers on Indian roads‚Äî increased in 2019. As many as 128,798 people lost their lives due to dangerous driving and overspeeding‚Äî83% of all road accident deaths, the NCRB data showed. This was a 2.2% rise since 2018.

In the new regime, the recommended penalty for overspeeding ranges between ‚Çπ1,000 and ‚Çπ4,000, depending on vehicle type. Dangerous driving is punishable with at least six months in prison, or a fine of ‚Çπ1,000 to ‚Çπ10,000, or both.

But only three of the six most accident-prone states‚ÄîMaharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh‚Äîwere able to reduce accidents due to dangerous driving and overspeeding. These three states, along with Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala, report the most road accidents year after year. Last year, these six accounted for 58% of all road accidents in India.





Most road accident deaths take place on national and state highways, even though they make up just about 5% of the Indian road network. In India‚Äôs 53 most populous cities, highways have a 42% share in accident deaths, but this rises to 62% in the rest of India, shows the data. This could be because of higher traffic density in cities, leading to lower speeds, Soi said.

There were 113 accidents for each 100 km of national highways, 61 on state highways, and just four on other roads.





The risk on highways can be mitigated through electronic enforcement, which is mandated by the Section 136A of the Motor Vehicles Act, and touted by the centre as one of the key features of the 2019 amendments. But very few states are using it, Tewari said.

Road accidents cost India dearly. The age group of 18 to 45 is involved in 70% of them, shows government data.

If India can halve the casualties in road accidents for 24 years, it can improve its per capita income by 14%, according to the World Bank.

India‚Äôs union roads minister Nitin Gadkari may have hoped that the new law will act as a strong deterrent. But the resistance from the rest of the political establishment seems to have diluted its impact. This year, the pandemic-induced lockdown may have saved many lives by taking traffic off our roads. But as traffic returns to usual levels across cities, the risks of accidental deaths are also likely to rise.

485,"National highways in south account for most road accidents, black spots; UP, Tamil Nadu top among states","Given the regional disparities in the national highway network in India and the concentration of traffic-related injuries to a few states or regions, a localised approach to road safety may be more suited

In India, every year more people die of road traffic injuries or road accidents than of malaria, tuberculosis or HIV. In 2019 alone, over 1.51 lakh people died due to injuries caused by road accidents. This was more than the total deaths caused by the three diseases combined.

In 2019, malaria killed 7,700 people, the human immunodeficiency virus killed 58,960 while tuberculosis claimed 79,144 lives.

The situation, however, seems to be improving. Between 2018 and 2020 India witnessed a drop in road traffic injuries. While 1,40,843 road accidents were reported in national highways and expressways in 2018, they fell to 1,37,191 in 2019. The number of road accidents reduced further to 1,16,496 in 2020 (provisional data). The reduction in road traffic injuries was witnessed across all the seven major regions - south, north, east, west, north-west, north-east and central India.

NHs and expressways in south report maximum road traffic injuries

However, government data show that road accidents are concentrated in a few problem states such as Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, or regions such as south India.

As per the 2020 provisional data, south India (includes the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Goa, and the UTs of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, and Puducherry) accounted for 41.6 percent or 48,476 of the total 1,16,496 road traffic injuries. The figures were 59,280 in 2018 and 57,457 in 2019.

In contrast, all other regions, north, west, east, central, north-west and north-east reported less than 15,000 road accidents in 2020.

Region States Year 2018 Year 2019 Year 2020 South Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Goa, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Puducherry 59280 57457 48476 North Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand 17014 16843 14219 North West Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi and Rajasthan 18307 17118 13867 Central Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh 13962 14251 13296 East West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand 13910 14285 12884 West Gujarat, Maharashtra, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu 13352 11871 9735 North East Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura 5018 5366 3986 Grand Total 140843 137191 116496 SOURCE: Press Information Bureau, Government of India

Among other regions, in 2002, north (Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand) reported the second-highest (14,219) road accidents in 2020. The north-west region (Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi and Rajasthan), which reported the second-highest road traffic injuries in 2019 at 17,718 reduced the numbers to 13,867 in 2020.

It's to be noted that south India also accounts for the maximum length of national highways at 24,098 kilometres as of 2017.

But then, among states, Tamil Nadu in the south reported 15,269 road accidents, the highest in 2020. The southern state had 4,946 kilometres of national highways as of 2017. Uttar Pradesh, which had 8,712 kilometres of national highways (second highest in 2017), accounted for 13,695 road traffic injuries and Karnataka (6,762 kilometres of NHs in 2017) reported 11,230 road accidents. These three states have contributed the maximum number of road accidents in 2018 as well as 2019.

However, Maharashtra, which accounted for the largest network of national highways at 15,437 kilometres in 2017, reported 9,355, 8,360 and 6,501 in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

What's the solution?

Reducing deaths due to road traffic injuries in India has been a major focus of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) under Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari.

Stating the need for an engineering-driven approach to reduce road traffic injuries in India, the Union minister in June 2021 had said that 50 percent of the road accidents in India are due to road engineering problems. He added that the government has taken special initiatives to identify and improve black spots.

The ministry, according to a report published in June this year, is allocating ‚Çπ14,000 crores for states, the National Highways Authority of India and other stakeholders to remove black spots under a scheme sanctioned by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

On Thursday, PIB issued a statement by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH), stating that it has already identified 5,803 black spots on national highways based on accident and fatality data between 2015 and 2018 in 30 states and UTs.

The ministry said that temporary measures have been taken on 5,167 black spots and 2,923 Black spots have been permanently rectified.

What are black spots?

In transportation, a black spot is not a literal spot on the road, but a short stretch of the road usually of about 500 metres in length, which is prone to accidents.

As per MORTH, a stretch of road is termed a black spot if ""five accidents involving serious injuries/fatalities or ten fatalities took place during the past three calendar years"".

However, ""some times a single accident can have multiple fatalities, hence a number of fatal/grievous accidents at the same location is a better indicator of problematic road/road environment (ie, black spot) than the number of fatalities"".

Why are they crucial?

Identification and rectification of black spots on national highways and state highways (SHs) have been one of the dimensions of India's policies to reduce road traffic crashes. The rectification of black spots is done using short-term remedies such as installing cautionary road signs and markings, transverse bar markings, rumble strips and solar blinkers, etc, as well as long-term remedies such as providing flyover, underpasses, foot-over bridges, service roads, etc, wherever required.

The MORTH statement on Thursday said that some of these steps are being taken to rectify black spots. Besides, the NHAI, which is primarily responsible for constructing and managing national highways in India (NHIDCL and PWDs of states also manage them) has delegated financial power of up to Rs 50 crore to its regional officers to carry out rectification of black spots including land acquisition without sending files to NHAI headquarter for approval.

The ministry also said that it is taking traffic calming measures such as traffic warning signs, delineators, road studs, bar markings, humps at approach roads, etc, at vulnerable sections of National Highways to reduce road accident fatalities.

Is there a connection between black spots and accidents?

Earlier in the story, we looked at the states and regions which account for the maximum number of road accidents in national highways and expressways, now let us take a look at the concentration of black spots in the national highways and expressways from 30 states and UTs, data for which has been collected by MORTH's Transport Research Wing (TRP).

Region States Black spots South Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Goa, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Puducherry 2,493 East West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand 992 North West Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi and Rajasthan 967 North Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand 459 Central Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh 445 West Gujarat, Maharashtra, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu 304 North East Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura 143 Grand Total 5,803 SOURCE: Press Information Bureau, Government of India

As it's clear from the data above, national highways and expressways in south India account for the maximum number 2,493 of black spots -- nearly 43 percent of the 5,803 identified by the TRP.

While the concentration of black spots in other regions does not follow the same pattern as road accidents (check table at the top), the concentration of black spots is located majorly in five regions -- south, east, north-west, north and central -- which also reported the maximum number of road accidents.

Going beyond the national highways, expressways

India reported a total of 4,49,002 accidents in the year 2019. These accidents led to 1,51,113 accidental deaths and 4,51,361 accidental injuries. Based on recent data released by MORTH, of the nearly 4.5 lakh accidents that took place in 2019, 1,37,191 or 30.5 percent occurred in national highways and expressways.

These figures are indeed a matter of concern for the MORTH which owns the national highways, especially given the low distribution of the national highways -- the NHs accounted for just 1.94 percent of India's total roads as of 2017. But the situation on the flipside (other roads) seems just as alarming.

The remaining roads -- state highways (2.97 percent), district (9.94 percent), rural (70.65 percent) and urban roads (8.93 percent) and project roads (5.58 percent) -- are likely to be where the remaining 69.5 percent road accidents might be taking place.

While the MORTH's focus on improving black spots in national highways and expressways is a crucial initiative that needs to be completed on priority. Any initiative to reduce road accidents in India will be incomplete if it fails to include the state highways, district roads, rural roads.

MORTH didn't release any data related to road safety initiatives on these roads on Thursday.

Also, given the existing regional disparities in the national highway network in India, and the concentration of traffic-related injuries to a few states or regions, a localised approach may be more suited.","While 1,40,843 road accidents were reported in national highways and expressways in 2018, they fell to 1,37,191 in 2019.

486,"‚ÄòIgnorance of rules, the major root cause for road accidents‚Äô","Despite penal laws and awareness programmes, people have not changed: HC

In a significant order passed recently, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court observed that it was high time the stakeholders had a rethink on fixing the blame on drivers of big vehicles in road accidents involving big and small vehicles. The court said that despite penal laws and awareness programmes, people had not changed.

The court said that every road user owes a duty of care and caution and was duty-bound to drive his vehicle in such a way not to endanger themselves and more importantly pedestrians, cyclists, two-wheeler riders and other vehicle users. There was a need for a campaign to enlighten public on rules and penalties, say advocates and RTO Officials.

The court had pointed out that as per statistics available for the past two years, in 2018, India ranked first in road accidents among 199 countries. There were 4.67 lakh accidents - those involving two-wheelers alone accounted for 35.2%, the highest in all categories of vehicles. It is pertinent to note that in India, Tamil Nadu stood first in the number of accidents. In 2019, there were 4.37 lakh accidents - 38% involving two-wheelers.

‚ÄúOne of the best ways to create awareness is to put up signboards at key junctions. Information on rules and penalties are on display at Regional Transport Offices. If they are also displayed at prime spots, they will better serve the purpose,‚Äù said advocate S. Srinivasa Raghavan. Corporates could sponsor the signboards through their corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative, he said.

Concurring with his suggestion, an official of the Regional Transport Office said signboards could be placed at bus stands, railway stations, airports and other public places to create awareness of the traffic rules among the public in a more effective way.

Major violations

Signal jumping, drunk driving, overspeeding, overloading, non-usage of helmets and seatbelts and using mobile phones while driving are the major traffic violations, the official said. ‚ÄúSpeeding and overtaking on the wrong side are the major reasons for accidents,‚Äù he said.

While strict enforcement of rules will bring down traffic violations, people must start practising road safety precautions on their own volition. ‚ÄúThere are many posts lying vacant in the RTOs, which makes it difficult to ensure strict enforcement of rules. Hence, placing boards on the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act at public places is the first step in creating awareness among the public,‚Äù he said.","There was a need for a campaign to enlighten public on rules and penalties, say advocates and RTO Officials.

487,Gurgaon: Two men fall to death from flyover after their bike crashes,"A college student and his friend, both suspected to be in their early 20s, died as they fell from the elevated road of IFFCO Chowk U-turn flyover after their motorcycle lost balance and crashed into the flyover re-wall on Sunday morning.

Police said the victims were tossed in the air upon impact and fell on the surface road beneath from a height of at least 20 feet.

Police said the deceased have been identified as Saiyad ur Rehman, a college student from Leh, and his friend, Mohammad Zaid, who hailed from Mandikhera in Mewat.

While Rehman was declared dead on arrival, Zaid died during treatment at a private hospital in Sector 38 on Sunday night, said police.

According to police, the incident took place around 11.30 am, when the victims were about to take a U-turn on the IFFCO Chowk flyover towards the Sukhrali side. Police said they were coming from the Delhi side on a Royal Enfield motorcycle.

A police officer said, ‚ÄúIt is suspected that while navigating the U-turn, the motorcycle lost balance and rammed straight into the 2-2.5 feet re-wall. The motorcycle, being heavy, fell near the re-wall, while the occupants were flung from the flyover upon collision.‚Äù

A team from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) reached the spot and inspected the site of the crash.

An NHAI official, requesting anonymity, said, ‚ÄúOne of the victims fell on a car and the other fell straight on the road. Both suffered serious injuries on their head, back and several parts of the body. Several commuters and traffic police rushed them to a private hospital nearby.‚Äù

Police said they had informed the families of the deceased and they are on their way to Gurgaon. The incident led to traffic congestion for over ten minutes at IFFCO Chowk beneath the flyover. Following the incident, a team from Sector 29 police station rushed to the spot.

‚ÄúThe statement of the families of the victims is yet to be recorded. No case has been registered as of now. The sequence of events is not certain and it is unclear what caused the accident. We will check CCTVs in the area during the probe,‚Äù said a police officer, requesting anonymity.

The bodies have been kept in the mortuary for a post-mortem.

As per statistics compiled by the Maharashtra Highway Police, Nashik tops in deaths by accident, while Mumbai tops in people injured in accidents. However, the police said that the number of accident cases as compared to pre-Covid levels is 37% less in the city and 20% less in the state.

As per statistics, for the period of January to June 2021, there were around 14,245 accident cases reported in the state. In the same period, 6,708 accidental death were reported, while 10,879 people were injured.

‚ÄúMumbai contributed around 6.7% cases, with 956 accidents, 131 deaths and 809 people reported injured,‚Äù said a police officer from the state Highway Police department. From January to June 2020, the city had seen around 809 accident cases, in which around 141 people had died and around 822 people were injured.

However, the accident cases last year were less due to strict Covid-19 lockdown.

Most numbers of the fatalities in accidents happened in Nashik Rural jurisdiction with around 454 deaths, followed by Pune Rural with 418 deaths. Ahmednagar reported 367 deaths, Jalgaon 267, Solapur 255, Satara 243 and Nagpur 242 deaths.

‚ÄúWe have been continuously working on the factors and studying them to reduce the number of accidents, most importantly fatalities. We have identified several black spots and are working on them to correct the problems. We are making people aware of over-speeding, which is a major cause of accidents.

Upadhyay said they have also trained 1,000 locals, like garage owners, toll booth staff, puncture shop owners and even some dhaba staffers as Mrityunjay Doot‚Äôs, to provide immediate relief and medical attention to accident victims.

If we compare the accident cases with 2019 figures, there are 20% fewer accident cases, 5% fewer deaths on roads and 30% less injured people.

In a normal year like 2019, there were around 32,925 accident cases in the state, 12,788 deaths and 28,628 injured people due to accidents, said Upadhyay.

Accident cases have decreased in cities like Buldhana, Palghar and Thane.

‚ÄúThis year due to several restrictions and local trains still being closed for people, they tend to come out for work via their private vehicles. Several mail express trains have been cancelled. Those wanting to travel outstation can‚Äôt travel without reservations. Hence, more people are using their private vehicles, leading to more accidents. The government needs to concentrate more on improving public transport, especially making special bus lanes for government buses and increasing their frequency,‚Äù said Ashok Datar a transport expert from the city.","Road accidents in the city have increased by 15% during the past six months, as compared to the number of accidents during the corresponding period last year.
As per statistics compiled by the Maharashtra Highway Police, Nashik tops in deaths by accident, while Mumbai tops in people injured in accidents.
As per statistics, for the period of January to June 2021, there were around 14,245 accident cases reported in the state.
‚ÄúMumbai contributed around 6.7% cases, with 956 accidents, 131 deaths and 809 people reported injured,‚Äù said a police officer from the state Highway Police department.

Washington: Output by US industries fell 1.3 percent last month amid continued supply constraints hindering manufacturing, the Federal Reserve reported Monday.Declines were apparent across multiple categories, but stark in the auto sector, with production of motor vehicles and parts falling 7.2 percent ""as shortages of semiconductors continued to hobble operations,"" the central bank said.The drop came as a surprise as economists were forecasting a modest increase in industrial production.And after reporting a gain in August that returned total output in the world's largest economy to its pre-pandemic level, the Fed revised the data to instead show a decline.Faced with ongoing supply bottlenecks, factory output fell 0.7 percent last month after a 0.4 percent drop in August according to the revised data.Mining, including oil drilling, plunged 2.3 percent, while cooler weather contributed to the 3.6 percent drop in utilities output.However, the report said some of the declines were due to the impact of Hurricane Ida, which caused flooding and destruction in parts of Louisiana and the northeastern United States.""The lingering effects of Hurricane Ida more than accounted for the drop in mining in September; they also contributed 0.3 percentage point to the drop in manufacturing,"" the report said.""Overall, about 0.6 percentage point of the drop in total industrial production resulted from the impact of the hurricane.""Despite the declines, total output is 4.6 percent above September 2020.However, industrial capacity in use declined sharply to 75.2 percent, a full point lower than in August.","China's economic growth weakens amid construction slowdown The world's second-largest economy grew 4.9% over a year ago in the three months ending in September, down from the previous quarter's 7.9%, government data showed Monday.

491,Sleep testing can reduce sleep disorder related road accidents in India,"India is one of the countries with an alarmingly high number of deaths attributed to road accidents. Not only casualties but a huge number of people get injured seriously every year due to road accidents and many of these people become handicapped every year. In the last decade, road accidents caused death for 13 lakh people, and another 50 lakh people got injured in the country, as revealed by a study by World Bank.

In terms of vehicular pollution, India has only 1% of total vehicles in the world, while the country accounts for 11% of the global death due to road accidents, which is the highest in the world. India accounts for around 4.5 lakh road accidents every year, which claims around 1.5 lakh lives. This means every hour, the country witnesses around 53 road accidents killing one person every 4 minutes.

Many of these accidents happen on the highways and expressways, involving large commercial vehicles. While there are several reasons behind these accidents, one of them is lack of sleep. A study conducted in 2020 by SaveLIFE Foundation and Mahindra revealed that truck drivers in India drive 12 hours a day covering around 417 km, with almost 50% of them admitting that they feel sleepy or tired while driving. Many of these truck drivers or bus drivers who drive vehicles on highways suffer from Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), a disorder that majorly goes undetected because of lack of testing.

OSA could actually create very risky situations when it comes to road safety. According to Sibasish Dey, Head, Medical Affairs, Asia and Latin America, ResMed, sleep apnea increases the risk of road accidents by 300% and is the cause behind many major road accidents in India. According to a study by Lancet, in India, there are around 28 million people who suffer from sleep apnea, and clearly, that leads to many drowsy drivers on Indian roads. The drivers with OSA are around 2.6 times prone to road accidents than general drivers.

The untreated sleep disorders, excessive pressure on drivers can result in a reduced level of alertness on roads. As AIIMS Neurology India‚Äôs research has found, more than 20% of all road accident victims are found suffering from sleep disorders and OSA. Another study revealed that more than 23% of truck drivers have sleep deprivation. Clearly, these drowsy drivers can cause fatal accidents on roads.

Economic impact:

Back in 2016, the deaths and serious injuries caused by road crashes cost around 7.5% of India's GDP or ‚Çπ12.9 lakh crore, revealed the World Bank study. The amount is more than double the figure cited by the Indian government at 3% of GDP or ‚Çπ4.3 lakh crore. According to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) findings, the socio-economic costs of road crashes in India is at ‚Çπ147,114 crore, which is equivalent to 0.77% of the country's GDP.

The injuries and deaths due to the road accidents impose a severe financial burden and push the respective victims‚Äô households into poverty and the already poor into debt. Road crashes also impact heavily on the country‚Äôs human assets. Around 76.2% of people who are killed in road crashes in India are in their prime working-age, 18-45 years. This means the country loses a massive number of its workforce every year, just because of road accidents.

What‚Äôs the solution?

Sleep disorder and its effect on road safety is something that gets very little attention in India. The lack of awareness among the policymakers, drivers, OEMs, and other stakeholders should be a concern.

Several countries around the world conduct regular tests of drivers for sleep deprivation in an attempt to ensure safety on roads. Australia tests commercial vehicle drivers once every three years for drivers aged up to 49, and yearly for drivers aged 50 or more than that. In the EU countries as well drivers must seek a diagnosis in case of sleep apnea, and can only return to driving once the condition is under control.

As the Indian government has been taking several measures in order to enhance road safety, there should be an attempt to educate the drivers about the importance of sleep. While the policymakers need to take initiatives, the automobile OEMs too have equal responsibilities. The auto manufacturers can start awareness campaigns to educate vehicle buyers and drivers about sleep deprivation and its impact on road safety.","India is one of the countries with an alarmingly high number of deaths attributed to road accidents.

493,Indian roads are a big threat to commoners‚Äô lives,"We experience a bumpy ride every day while travelling across the city. Re-digging roads often worsen the scenario. The deplorable state of the city roads can be largely attributed to the re-digging of the roads on the whims and fancies of the authorities, and it worsens during the rainy season leading to many accidents. We can‚Äôt pinpoint anyone in particular for the state of affairs. The society at large is responsible for this awful situation ‚Äì poor infrastructure, BMC, inappropriate planning and the common public too is at fault. Because they are okay with what they have and they don‚Äôt want to take notice and register their annoyance.

The only thing that stops local development in Mumbai is huge corruption in BMC. Wherever we travel in Mumbai we can see garbage piles across roads, plastic depositions, potholes, and above all waterlogging. This is the situation in every monsoon. Many political parties ruled us but no one could really give relief to Mumbaikar from waterlogging.

Corruption in BMC is a systematic process, even though the tender process has become online and transparent. The tenders are floated, Bids are made, and interviews and reviews are conducted with contractors. A share of the total amount to be sanctioned for the development is secretly informed to the contractor. (If the contractor agrees the tender is awarded, else rejected).

It is obvious that the contractor who quotes figures lower than the base cost calculation is not going to do justice to the job. He is going to cheat by using inferior material or resorting to poor workmanship. The committee that awards the tender to the contractor does not have the guts NOT to award the tender to the lowest bidder and the corporation does not have sufficient people to closely monitor the quality of the material and the work when the contractor actually executes the job. Obviously, a road prepared this way is unlikely to last very long.

Now again relatives of these politicians themselves make most of the bids. Right from the MLA, Ward officer, tender committee, corporator, and other municipality personals involved etc. the money needs to be pocketed. Then the contractor is left with hardly any money where he can make any profit, so he uses underrated, third-grade material, which does not comply with the agreed tender requirements, but no one takes objection because the contractor keeps a lot of weight on their pockets. And within a few days, the roads were uprooted. And the taxpayer‚Äôs money goes into waterlog.

If an honest engineer tries to show that the bid should be higher, people start wondering why he is speaking in favour of increasing the price and start suspecting the engineer‚Äôs integrity. Everybody in the corporation knows that since the road is shortly going to crumble and will have to be resurfaced again next year, the actual cost of choosing the lowest bidder is way higher than what the most expensive bidder had quoted. But how does one challenge the rules of the tender process? What will the auditor say? There are so many people interested in the tender, any person who tries to break away is bound to get roasted, and the news reports and media are always around to look for a sensational story. They also publish the reports; flash the news but no follow-up.

Genuine people do not use the proactive act, Right to Information. Rather the namesake journalist used it. Normally no one looks into a government office, citing it won‚Äôt affect us. Let‚Äôs take an example of how the system works. Let us say one km stretch of road 27 meters wide needs to be resurfaced. The officers of the corporation, who are well-qualified engineers, make a calculation of how much it should cost to do the work, taking into account the specs, the quantity of material required, and the amount of time, labor rates, and cost of hiring equipment and so on. This amount is only used for internal purposes ‚Äì for allocating and blocking a budget.

After-effects‚Äô of said substandard work is never-ending inquiry and investigation. There would be never-ending court cases, never-ending political advantages and slowly the settlement. So until we have a responsible representative for our wards/constituency, which really has some good intention of development and making a change for the society, we can‚Äôt expect some good results in return. But corruption is still an underdog, and these politicians silence the people who raise their voices by doing Gundagiri or threatening. So everybody just goes through the motions and becomes apathetic to the obvious wrong that is being committed and just lives with the situation.

Above all, there is no single window system for the service given to the public, as such the public tend to go to all the departments for a single work or for NOC and if any officer is pending their paper, for minimizing the time schedule the people are required to give bribes to save their valuable time. There is no awareness of the right to service act as such, BMC officers are getting the benefit of this and they put up files at one corner of their table and wait for a party to come to them.

Can this system ever be changed? Yes, but it needs fearless engineers and even more, bosses who will back them up when it comes to the crunch. Moreover, we need clean politicians, but that is a rare possibility.","The society at large is responsible for this awful situation ‚Äì poor infrastructure, BMC, inappropriate planning and the common public too is at fault.

Over speeding is the major cause of road accidents and it has accounted to 54.70% of total road accidents in 2018, 84.40% in 2019 whereas the national rate was 71.10% for 2019.Similarly, 6,593 accidents occurred in 2020 and 4,328 in 2021 (till 31 July) and the corresponding deaths were 3,207 in 2019, 2,629 in 2020 and 1,789 in 2021 (till 31 July). As per the road accident data.Assam Transport Minister Chandra Mohan Patowary in a statement said, ‚Äò75.30% of the cause of 2,629 deaths in 2020 in Assam was due to over speeding despite the fact that the movement of vehicles were restricted in view of the Covid pandemic situation. Out of 2,629 deaths, 48% occurred in the national highways of Assam. Therefore special drive has been undertaken to check over speeding on highways.‚Äô""Speed limit on national highways is decided by NHAI, Government of India not by the State Transport Department .

496,Data: 26 States/UTs report 18% less Road Accidents & 15% less Deaths in Lockdown year 2020,"Road Accidents have been the leading cause of death among young adult males in India. India is also the country with most road accident deaths among 199 different countries. Though the number of road accidents has reduced by around 10% in the last 10 years, the number of deaths has increased. In the lockdown year of 2020, 26 States/UTs that have reported complete data, saw 18% less Road Accidents & 15% less Deaths.

India is among the countries that reports the greatest number of road accidents in the world. Every year, thousands of road accidents are reported across India resulting in fatalities and severe injuries. Road injuries are the leading cause of death among young adult males in India. According to the WHO, in 2019, road injury was among the top 10 causes of deaths globally. More people lost their lives to road injuries than to tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, or liver cirrhosis. Road accidents are a socio-economic burden on the victims‚Äô households as well as on the economy. Unlike certain chronic illnesses and diseases, road injuries are preventable through effective interventions and stringent enforcement of rules, as most of them occur due to negligence, poor infrastructure, and carelessness.

An average of 1200+ road accidents were reported daily in India in 2019

Responding to a question in the parliament recently, the Union Government stated that the total number of road accidents in the country stood at 4,49,002 during 2019. Compared to 2018, the number has dropped by nearly 4%. The trend in the number of reported road accidents from 2010 as per the annual ‚ÄòRoad Accidents in India‚Äô report reveals that the least number of accidents were reported in 2019. In 2010, 5.28 lakh road accidents had taken place, and since then there has been a gradual decrease in the number of such accidents. Between 2010 & 2019, there has been a 10% reduction in the number of road accidents. The data is based on information supplied by the Police Departments of States and UTs. Hence, the actual number of accidents may be higher.

According to data presented in the Lok Sabha earlier this year, 26 states/UTs had submitted data for the entire calendar year 2020. The data indicated that the total number of accidents in these 26 states/UTs had dropped by around 48,500 in 2020, a reduction of more than 18% compared to 2019. The nationwide lockdown and movement restrictions imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19 may have also contributed to the reduction.

Fatality due to road accidents is highest in India

India ranks first in the number of road accident deaths among 199 countries and accounts for almost 11% of the accident-related deaths in the world, according to the Road Accidents in India 2019 report 2019. Though the number of accidents has reduced in the last 10 years, the number of fatalities has gone up. In 2019, 1.51 lakh persons lost their lives due to road accidents, which is merely 0.2% less than 2018. The fatalities number was about 1.35 lakhs in 2010 and has increased by around 12% between 2010 & 2019.

In 2020, the 26 states/UTs reported a decline in the number of deaths due to road accidents by more than 13,000 or 15%. Over 79,000 deaths were reported in 2020 in these 26 states compared to more than 93,000 deaths in 2019. As noted earlier, this could be because of the nationwide lockdown that restricted the movement of people & vehicles.

However, the possibility of under-reporting in fatalities cannot be ruled out. The data reported by police does not include the deaths that take place in hospitals after 30 days if the hospital data and police data are not linked. Further, fatalities in which the person who caused the accident cannot be identified will not be reported since crime/offence under IPC must be lodged against an individual and not against the road or vehicle or any object.

In 2019, around 4.51 lakh persons were injured in road accidents, the lowest since 2010. The number of persons injured in road accidents has dropped by almost 15% between 2010 & 2019.

90% of Road Accidents were reported by 15 states

A total of 15 states together account for more than 90% of the accidents since 2015. In the last five years, Tamil Nadu topped the list with an average of more than 65,000 accidents reported each year. The state reported more than 70,000 accidents in 2016 which has dropped to over 57,000 in 2019. Tamil Nadu reported close to 45,500 accidents in 2020, the lowest since 2015, yet the highest in India. The majority of the accidents in the state took place on the state and national highways. Tamil Nadu also had the highest number of black spots in the country, which is defined as a 500-meter stretch on the national highways where 5 road accidents or 10 fatalities took place in the last three years. Though Tamil Nadu reported the most accidents, Uttar Pradesh reported the greatest number of fatalities.

Since 2015, among the top 15 states, the states of Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and West Bengal have reported a drop in the number of accidents whereas the states of Bihar, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, and Kerala have reported an increase in the number of road accidents. Seven of these states- Telangana, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, and Gujarat which have reported data for January to December 2020, have reported a drop in accidents even in 2020.

2 out of 3 fatalities in road accidents were due to overspeeding

Over speeding was the reason behind more than 70% of the accidents and 67% of the fatalities, in 2019. Other contributors to the high incidence of road accidents in the country are drunken driving, driving on the wrong side or lane indiscipline, jumping red lights, and usage of phones which are due to poor enforcement of traffic rules.

India ranks 3 globally in terms of total accidents

According to World Road Statistics- 2018 of the International Road Federation, India ranks 3rd in terms of total accidents, among 199 countries. The USA tops the list with more than 31 Lakh accidents. In terms of the incidence of accidents per lakh population, India‚Äôs incidence is 36 per lakh people which is much less than many developed and developing countries like the USA (684), Japan (393), Iran (365) and Turkey (233). However, in terms of fatalities, India tops the list.

Road crash had a severe impact on the vulnerable- poorer households, rural households, and women

A study titled ‚ÄòTraffic Crash Injuries and Disabilities: The Burden on Indian Society‚Äô was conducted by the World Bank to assess the socio-economic impact of road crashes in India across 4 states ‚Äî Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra which accounted for most road accident deaths in the country. It surveyed accident cases and corresponding families of victims to understand the relation between road crash fatalities and poverty, inequality, and vulnerable road users in India. The key findings of the study are as follows-

Fatalities from road crashes are higher among poor families: The risk of a victim undergoing disability after a crash was also 2 times more likely among poor rural households.

The burden of the road crashed is disproportionately borne by poor households: More than 75% of poor households reported a decline in their income because of a road accident, as compared to 54% among high-income households. About 42% of the poor household respondents reported that their household went into debt because of borrowing money after a crash as compared to 11% of respondents from richer households.

Sharp rural-urban divide: The severe impact of the decline in income was highest among poor households in rural areas (56%) compared to those in urban areas (29.5%).

Women have been highly impacted: Women in the families of victims, irrespective of income, often had to take up extra work, assume greater responsibilities, and perform caregiving activities. 50% of women said they were severely affected by the decline in their household income after an accident. While around 11% reported taking up extra work to deal with the financial crisis, 40% of women reported a change in their working patterns post-crash.

Inequality in Insurance coverage and compensation : Insurance coverage was significantly higher among high-income households and households in urban areas as compared to lower-income households in urban areas. About 24% of respondents from high-income households said that they received compensation while, among poorer respondents, only 14% received compensation from insurance companies.

: Insurance coverage was significantly higher among high-income households and households in urban areas as compared to lower-income households in urban areas. About 24% of respondents from high-income households said that they received compensation while, among poorer respondents, only 14% received compensation from insurance companies. Other issues: In addition to financial distress, poor households also experienced a deterioration in their quality of life accompanied by psychological suffering and emotional distress.

Policy-based approaches have been recommended to save lives

The report suggests policy-oriented approaches for saving lives and improving the ability of victims and their families to get back on their feet. Some of the approaches suggested are the following

Inclusion of provision for immediate financial, medical, and legal aid.

Strengthening of health infrastructure and coverage to be made accessible and inclusive.

Post-crash support needs to be strengthened with governments providing a social security net for crash victims from low-income households.

Insurance coverage, especially for poor households must be expanded. An accessible legal framework for availing insurance and compensation for road crash victims should be created.

Considering the gender impact, governments should work on providing special schemes to support women.

497,"Air pollution is a growing problem in Africa, requiring long-term solutions","Photo: Pixabay/jozuadouglas

Air pollution takes millions of lives in countries with the worst levels of it such as China and India. Yet in Africa too, polluted air is an increasingly major health hazard, which killed as many 1.1 million people in 2019 alone, scientists say.

Air pollution in Africa frequently comes in the form of the indoor variety from cooking stoves, which accounted for an estimated 700,000 deaths while outdoor air pollution claimed another 400,000 lives, according to scientists at Boston College and the United Nations‚Äô Environment Programme.

‚ÄúHousehold air pollution is the predominant form of air pollution, but it is declining, whereas ambient air pollution is increasing,‚Äù explain the scientists in a paper published in The Lancet medical journal.

In addition to the lives lost, air pollution costs African countries billions of dollars in gross domestic product. Economic output lost to air-pollution-related diseases was $3 billion in Ethiopia, or 1.16 percent of the country‚Äôs gross domestic product; $1.6 billion in Ghana (0.95 percent of GDP), and $349 million in Rwanda (1.19 percent of GDP), the scientists found.

‚ÄúThe most disturbing finding was the increase in deaths from ambient air pollution,‚Äù said Philip Landrigan, director of Boston College‚Äôs Global Observatory on Pollution and Health, a leader of the research team which assessed how air pollution was affecting people‚Äôs health and countries‚Äô economies across Africa with a focus on Ethiopia, Ghana and Rwanda.

Air pollution in Africa is bad as it is, but worse is to come, the scientists warn.

‚ÄúWhile this [current] increase is still modest, it threatens to increase exponentially as African cities grow in the next two to three decades and the continent develops economically,‚Äù Landrigan said.

Within this century Africa‚Äôs population is set to triple from 1.3 billion people in 2020 to 4.3 billion by 2100. In tandem with the continent‚Äôs ever-increasing population, urban areas are growing and so are levels of air pollution driven by the burning of fossil fuels. At the same time, pollutive indoor cooking practices in badly ventilated abodes remain commonplace.

‚ÄúIndoor and outdoor sources combine to make air pollution the second largest cause of death in Africa, claiming more lives than tobacco, alcohol, motor vehicle accidents, and drug abuse. Only AIDS causes more deaths. Africa is part of a global toll taken by air pollution, which killed an estimated 6.7 million people worldwide in 2017,‚Äù the scientists explain.

Alarmingly, exposure to air pollution also stuns the intellectual development of many of the continent‚Äôs children, which could have grave repercussions for their mental health.

Because of the toll air pollution takes in various ways, there is a need for increased investment in pollution controls across Africa, the experts say. Measures should include investing in clean renewable energy; reducing road traffic and traffic-related pollution through measures such as creating vehicle-free zones; and regulating agricultural burning as well as the open burning of waste by households.

‚ÄúWe encourage Africa‚Äôs leaders to take advantage of the fact that their countries are still relatively early in their economic development and to transition rapidly to wind and solar energy, thus avoiding entrapment in fossil-fuel-based economies,‚Äù Landrigan said.

‚ÄúAfrican countries are in a unique position to leapfrog over mistakes made elsewhere and to achieve prosperity without pollution,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúAir pollution in Africa threatens economic development and future growth, but can be avoided by wise leaders who transition rapidly to wind and solar energy and avoid entrapment by coal, gas and oil.‚Äù","‚ÄúHousehold air pollution is the predominant form of air pollution, but it is declining, whereas ambient air pollution is increasing,‚Äù explain the scientists in a paper published in The Lancet medical journal.

503,No letup in road accidents in Kerala capital,"Krishnachand K By

Express News Service

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Speeding, other traffic law violations, unscientific road design, bad lighting and lack of adequate warning signs near high-risk spots identified as major reasons. 201 people died in 769 mishaps in the city and 1,500 in rural limits in the district till June this year. Meeting today to discuss steps to be taken to reduce accidents across state

Even as the police have been carrying out various awareness drives to curb traffic violations, there is no dip in the number of road accidents in the district. Though the pandemic and subsequent lockdown reduced the number of accidents to an extent in 2020 and this year, the unscientific road design, and traffic law and speed violations still claim many lives on roads. As per the data available with the state police, a total of 2,269 accidents occurred till June this year. Of these, 769 mishaps took place in the city while 1,500 in rural limits. As many as 201 persons died in these accidents.

Last year, 3,557 road accidents were reported in the district -- 2,343 in rural limits and 1,214 in the city. In 2019, 5,222 accidents were reported in the district. Of these, 3,227 were reported in rural limits and 1,995 in the city. According to the statistics, 348 people lost their lives in various accidents that took place last year while 524 people died in 2019. Though the police erect barricades at various points on different roads, youngsters find ways to dodge the hurdles to indulge in the passion for speeding.

Their favourite haunts are roads such as Vellayambalam-Kowdiar and the newly developed NH 66 bypass. Many youngsters have been fined and warned against speeding, the police said. K Sanjay Kumar Gurudin, DIG ( south zone), told TNIE that an enforcement drive has been started for controlling speed, drunken driving and errant behaviour of the drivers, and it will be stricter in the coming days .

‚ÄúAccidents have multiple causes such as dangerous and rash driving, speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol, physical fatigue of drivers, mechanical condition of vehicles, and poor road conditions. The increasing vehicle density combined with less enforcement on roads had also contributed to more accidents in recent days. So, these need to be addressed,‚Äù he said. Motorists blamed the authorities for the accidents. They cite pothole-filled roads and bad lighting as the reasons for the accidents.

‚ÄùMany accidents take place at night. The lack of proper illumination on the stretches and absence of signage makes driving very difficult in the night. For instance, there are no streetlights on the newly developed NH bypass. This puts the motorists at risk in the late hours. Apart from the enforcement drive, the authorities should give importance to maintaining the roads,‚Äù said K V Nithun, a techie working in Technopark.

Meanwhile, Kerala Road Safety Authority (KRSA) is yet to complete the report identifying the high-priority black spots in the district where more accidents had occurred in 2019, 2020 and this year. Usually, the authority prepares the report based on the findings of National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC) by compiling the accident data of three years. As per the last report published in 2019, Pappanamcode junction is still the most critical ‚Äòblack spot‚Äô of the state. The black spots were identified based on the data from 2016 to 2018.

‚ÄúEfforts are on to identify new blackspots in the state. We have already intimated NATPAC to compile the data. The data has to be taken from the State Crime Records Bureau and police stations. So, it will take some time. However, a meeting chaired by the chief secretary will be convened on Thursday to discuss the steps to be taken to bring down the number of accidents and we will come up with solutions. Immediate actions will be taken including road markings and setting up of traffic signals on aa priority basis,‚Äù said Niju Azhageshan, director, Technical Support, KRSA. A place is identified as a black spot if five accidents causing fatalities or injuries or 10 fatalities have been reported in a 500-metre distance.

Of the 341 black spots in the district, 65 are located in the city including Karamana, Killippalam, Overbridge, Palayam, Kaimanam, Kesavadasapuram, Sreekariyam, Muttathara, Attingal and Pettah.

In rural limits, Attingal, Balaramapuram, Aralumoodu near Neyyattinkara , Amaravila, Kallambalam and Parassala are high-risk blackspots on the national highway under state PWD. On MC Road, the high-risk spots are at Paruthippara junction, Mannanthala junction, Kilimanoor junction, Gokulam Medical College-Alanthara and Kanyakulangara junction. Similarly, there are many roads in various local body wards have been identified as accident-prone.","201 people died in 769 mishaps in the city and 1,500 in rural limits in the district till June this year.

504,Towards safer roads,"Photo by Akshay Nanavati on Unsplash

India witnesses the most road crash-related fatalities in the world. Around 29 children die every day in road accidents and about 1.5 lakh road crash-related deaths occur every year. Rash driving, bad road infrastructure and weak traffic law enforcement have been the major factors contributing to road accidents. Moreover, Indian automobiles lack the Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS) that minimise human errors in driving and reduce road accidents. With features like automatic braking, collision warning and lane-keeping assistance, ADAS is a common feature found in automobiles in developed countries.

In a recent study, Dr Anna Charly and Prof Tom Mathew from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) have analysed the factors that lead to road crashes, which will help develop ADAS suited to the Indian driving conditions. The study was published in the journal Transportation Letters and partially funded by the Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Bombay.

The well-tested ADAS from western countries cannot be directly brought into the Indian markets. These systems are designed according to the driving behaviour, road signs and road infrastructure of a particular place.

‚ÄúThe driving behaviour in India is very different from western countries. Most crashes here occur because of abrupt lane manoeuvring and overtaking, whereas driving discipline is mostly maintained abroad. So risky driving in India has to be identified differently,‚Äù explains Dr Charly, an expert on road safety.

Unlike in previous studies, the researchers analysed a broad range of factors affecting road safety like driving behaviour, the curvature of the road, the presence of steep slopes and time of the day. They chose the 94-kilometre-long Mumbai-Pune expressway, which includes a variety of road terrains and has a long history of frequent road crashes, for their study. They recorded real-time data, such as position, speed and acceleration, of 23 car drivers travelling on the expressway to study the typical driving behaviour. Then, they painstakingly studied the average driving behaviour on 188 segments ‚Äî each one kilometre in length ‚Äî of the expressway, and used it to explain previous road crash data on different road terrains.

The team noticed some patterns in their observations. Most of the previous road crashes had occurred on road segments which were either curved and flat or had a downward slope. On such segments, drivers very often changed lanes and speeds. They also observed many crashes on roads that steeped downward, irrespective of how the drivers drove. To identify the most important road safety factors to predict crashes, they calculated the ‚Äòcorrelation‚Äô between each factor and previous road crash data ‚Äî that is, how likely was it that some factor often led to road crashes?

The researchers concluded that frequent change in driving speeds was unsafe, especially during the night. And abrupt changing of lanes was dangerous, especially during the day. Steep downward roads were also more accident-prone. They used these factors to model possible future road crash scenarios, which they verified using previous crash data. ‚ÄúTraditional road safety analysis is ‚Äòreactive‚Äô and uses road crash data which is often improperly reported without crucial details. So instead, we used a ‚Äòproactive‚Äô approach to identify ‚Äòsurrogate‚Äô events (warning signs of a possible crash) from traffic and driving behaviour data,‚Äù says Prof Mathew. ‚ÄúOur approach eliminates the need for less reliable road crash data, and can be used for new traffic facilities where such data isn't available.‚Äù Their model can be used to set thresholds for risky driving behaviour and help the ADAS take automatic counter measures.

Though the study was conducted on an expressway, the results can be extended to the city roads.

‚ÄúOur conclusions on the important factors, and how they could be risky, apply to all types of roads because the driving behaviour is the same. Only the thresholds would be different,‚Äù says Dr Charly. ‚ÄúFor example, on expressways vehicles are allowed to travel at very high speeds, unlike within a city. So driving performance thresholds are set taking that into consideration,‚Äù she adds.

The researchers are currently improving their prediction model. ‚ÄúWe mainly studied passenger cars, but driving behaviour depends on the type of vehicle. A behaviour which is significant among car drivers might not be so for two-wheeler or truck drivers. We also want to study environmental parameters like rain and visibility,‚Äù says Dr Charly. Interestingly, the UN had declared 2010‚Äì20 as the decade of action for road safety. With efforts on the research front as well, let us hope for safer roads in future.

505,"Despite lockdown, no big drop in accidents, deaths on road during 2020 in Maharashtra","The coronavirus-induced lockdown shut down Maharashtra for the better part of 2020 but an analysis of the Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) data has found that while road accidents across the state dropped by a quarter from 2019, fatalities came down by just 10 per cent.

A total of 24,971 road accidents were reported in 2020 that left 11,569 people dead. Despite the lockdown restrictions on movement, accidents dropped 24 per cent, and fatalities remained high in comparison to 2019 when 32,925 crashes had led to 12,788 deaths.

Of the 10,773 fatal accidents, an average of over 1,000 accidents was reported in January and February alone. Between March and September, this number fell below a thousand. The lowest number of 282 fatal accidents was reported in April, causing 303 fatalities. The highest number of 1,368 accidents took place in December, in which 1,462 people were killed.

The reason behind this high number of accidents, a senior HSP official said, could be attributed to the high volume of vehicles on the road due to the discontinuance of the train services and speeding.

The massive numbers of people walking on the highways, trying to escape the Maharashtra lockdown and reach home in other dsitricts within Maharashtra or in other states, were also vulnerable to road accidents.

Across India, most of the horrific road accidents reported in 2020 were the ones that claimed the lives of migrant workers on their way back home on foot amid the lockdown, and Maharashtra was no exception. While the worst tragedy took place when a freight train mowed down 16 migrant workers walking on the tracks, four other labourers were crushed to death and three injured in the early days of the lockdown when a speeding truck ran over them at Bharol village in Virar on Mumbai-Ahmedabad Highway on March 28. The men were headed to their villages in Rajasthan on foot but had been turned back from the Maharashtra-Gujarat border. The truck hit them from behind.

According to the HSP road accident data for 2020 accessed by The Indian Express, of the total road accident fatalities in the state, 2,214 were pedestrians who died after being hit by vehicles ‚Äî the second-highest fatality after 5,868 two-wheeler riders who accounted for over half the total fatalities. Four-wheeler accidents, too, led to 1,576

fatalities.

A bulk of the fatalities (9,152 deaths or 79%) were caused by speeding. Another 3,160 deaths were reported in hit-and-run cases but the type of collision could not be ascertained in

these deaths.

The highest fatalities were reported from Pune rural (696 deaths in 1,230 accidents), Nashik rural (801 deaths in 1,239 accidents) and Ahmednagar (642 deaths in 1,225 accidents). At 1,812, Mumbai recorded the highest number of accidents in the state but fewer deaths at 349.

Dhawal Ashar of World Resources Institute (WRI), India, a non-profit group that works to prevent road accidents in Mumbai, said, ‚ÄúIt is a worrying trend in Pune rural if over one out of every two crashes are fatal, unlike Mumbai where it could be possibly ascribed to many factors, including the high vehicle density.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn Mumbai, the speed of vehicles is less as compared to highways and so the severity of accidents and injuries are more on highways. Further, in Mumbai trauma care is easily accessible but on highways, this is a major concern,‚Äù said Rajeev Choubey, risk management specialist of Resilient India, a non-profit group helping the state government to reduce accidents.","A total of 24,971 road accidents were reported in 2020 that left 11,569 people dead.

507,Road accidents in India are like silent pandemic: Rajnath Singh,"Voicing his concerns over rising road accidents, Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said India accounts for nearly 11 per cent of the total road accidents in the world and it is no less than a silent pandemic.

Addressing the 'Karmayogis' of Border Road Organisation (BRO) via video conferencing, the Union Defence Minister said, ""Accidents on the roads are a cause of great concern for us today. It is a matter of great surprise that our country has less than 3 per cent of the world's total vehicles, but accidents are close to 11 per cent. Every year around 4.5-5 lakh accidents and 1.5 lakh unfortunate deaths occur in the country. It is not less than a silent pandemic.""

""To get rid of all this, whatever steps the government has taken, such as approving the 'National Road Safety Policy', bringing in the 'Motor Vehicle Act 2020', identifying black spots on national highways...these centres also have their own importance,"" he said.

BRO on Friday launched four new software for works management, road infrastructure digitisation, human resource management and recruitment management.

""The four software being launched today will bring efficiency to the work of the organization and will also save their time. Their creation also marks the success of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' and 'Digital India' campaigns,"" stated Singh.

The Union Defence Minister said the start of two 'Centres of Excellence' based on the study of 'Road Safety', and roads, bridges, tunnels, air-fields is a matter of great pride for the country. He said these centres complement each other in their objectives.

""Right from its inception, BRO has been playing a vital role in the progress of the nation by building roads, tunnels and other infrastructure in remote areas. The most important component is connectivity. For connectivity, our BRO personnel have been working tirelessly even in the midst of difficulties like severe winter, heat, rain, snowfall. In the last 5-7 years, BRO has made even more remarkable achievements,"" he said.

He emphasised the increase in the budget of BRO by three to four times during the last five to seven years is not a trivial matter. Apart from this, 3,270 sets of special high altitude clothing are approved for our engineers and other personnel.

The Union Defence Minister further mentioned the slogans like ""Sawdhani hati durghatna ghati"" also helps making people aware while on road.

Singh further extended his best wishes to woman biker Kanchan for her solo expedition.

""I feel good knowing about Kanchan ji who is going to start solo women motorcycle expedition today. I was told that at an early age she started riding a motorcycle. So far she has covered 21,000 km in 10 years. I wish her all the best for this expedition,"" he said.

508,Road Accidents in India - Goa Chronicle,"According to a report by World Bank, India has a mere 1% of the world‚Äôs vehicles but accounts for 11% of the global deaths due to road accidents, which is highest in the world! Undoubtedly, road accidents in India are a much more inimical enemy than the deadly virus.

Every year, India witnesses more than 4.5 lakh road crashes, in which 1.5 lakh people die. As per the World Bank report there happen 53 road crashes every hour in India, taking a toll on 1 person‚Äôs life every 4 minutes! All through the last decade, 50 lakh Indians got injured in road accidents while a whopping 13 lakh lost their lives.

According to a recent study commissioned by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), the socio- economic costs of road crashes at Rs. 1, 47, 114 crore in India, which is equivalent to 0.77% of the country‚Äôs GDP.As per the ministry, 76.2% of the people who lose their lives in road crashes are in their prime working age that is 18- 45 years.

All through 2019, a total of 1, 51, 113 people were killed in 4, 80, 652 road accidents, an average of 414 deaths a day or 17 deaths per hour. In 2019, India continued to account for the largest number of road fatalities in the world, followed by China with 63, 093 deaths in 2, 12, 846 accidents. While the USA recorded the highest number of road crashes- 22, 11, 439 in which 37, 461 deaths were reported in the same year.

While the leading cause of road crashes and deaths was found out to be speeding, two- wheelers were involved in most of the fatalities. The highest number of road accidents was witnessed by Tamil Nadu (57, 228), followed by Madhya Pradesh (50, 669), Uttar Pradesh (42, 572), Kerala (41, 111) and Karnataka (40, 658).

As far as road fatalities among cities was concerned, Delhi retained its first rank in 2019 with 1, 463 deaths, followed by Jaipur (1, 283 deaths), Chennai (1, 252 deaths) and Bengaluru (768 deaths).

According to the World Bank, the road crash fatality rate is three- times higher in low-income countries compared to high income countries. The report stated, ‚ÄúThere is a distinct correlation between socio- economic status and road use patterns in low and middle income countries and poor people are more likely to be involved in a road traffic crash.‚Äù

In a country like India, the income level of an individual directly determines the mode of transport used by the person; and vulnerable road users are forced to share space with other less vulnerable users. This therefore increases the amount of risk faced by a particular road user. The World Bank report also stated that daily wage workers and casual labourers are more prone to be defined as vulnerable as compared to individuals engaged in regular activities.

Thus, the vulnerable road users constitute of poor male users coming from the working age category and these users account for more than half of all the road crash fatalities and injuries in India.

It is the ultimate fact of the matter that majority of these accidents are caused by human negligence and a callous attitude while on the roads. All through our childhood, teachers have taught us to follow the traffic rules and be a responsible citizen and an alert driver, alas, we tend to forget the values and rules as we grow up and that results into Indians turning into irresponsible citizens with a dearth of civic sense. Now this doesn‚Äôt mean that only the drivers ought to be responsible, many a time, the drivers follow the traffic rules, it is the pedestrian who is at fault; therefore, as Indians we literally need to learn to walk while on the roads too!

Nevertheless, one of the major causes which lead to road crashes is distracted driving. Driving needs undivided attention; READING OR REPLYING TO TEXTS, ATTENDING CALLS, LISTENING TO SONGS CAN WAIT! What good will these things do if you lose your life?

Another dangerous cause of the same is driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. DO NOT DRINK AND DRIVE! Kindly take a cab home if you‚Äôve had a drink or let your sober friend drive. Don‚Äôt think that you won‚Äôt be intoxicated after partying the whole night! On another note, TRY QUITTING ALCOHOL AND DRUGS! They are anyhow perilous to your health and life!

Most of the accidents on road occur due to speeding. Reckless driving leads to the most horrible of crashes, DO NOT THINK YOU LOOK ‚ÄòCOOL‚Äô WHILE YOU HIT THE THROTTLE OR PUSH THE ACCELERATOR FURTHER. The speed might thrill you but it can anytime kill you! Also important is time management- try to be on time. Mostly, people need to rush to offices or any other location where they are expected to be because they‚Äôre running late. Try to reach places on time; you won‚Äôt be needed to turn into a formula 1 racer then!

There are two things of utmost importance whose very existence is ignored by Indians on road- your helmet or seat belt! Kindly wear your helmet if on a two- wheeler; your hairstyle won‚Äôt save your life, your helmet will. Similarly, why can‚Äôt we wear a seat belt while driving a car? Not only it keeps our body posture straight but also prevents the chances of fatalities in case of a head to head collision. HOW DO YOU THINK IT‚ÄôLL FEEL WITH THE STEERING WHEEL BREAKING INTO YOUR RIBCAGE? Definitely not a pretty sight to imagine or a sensation worth enjoying!

Lastly, traffic rules are meant to follow and not only be studied during school! A single and simple broken rule can lead to massive havoc, KINDLY KEEP ALL YOUR EXCUSES ASIDE AND FOLLOW THE RULES, the reason to rush can wait but your life won‚Äôt wait before it bids goodbye!

He congratulated Nikhil Mehta and Ajay Tadinada for their efforts in launching ‚ÄòOxygen on Wheels' initiative reaching out to the door steps of differently-abled people in remote places amid the pandemic.On the occasion, Muraleedharan presented leadership awards to Mehta and Tadinada.Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Jaipur Foot USA continued its efforts to provide free artificial limb fitments to differently-abled people through specially-designed mobile van. Jaipur Foot USA chairman Prem Bhandari said the fully-equipped mobile van has technicians and experts who will be able to carry out 8-10 artificial limb fitments each day. New York-based youngster Nikhil Mehta had come up with the idea of the mobile vans.Tadinada, who is part of the Jaipur Foot youth wing, had met BMVSS founder Padma Bhushan DR Mehta for the first time when he was in 9th grade, and was inspired by his work. As part of the Jaipur Foot USA youth initiative, he has launched an internship programme for youth to work with Jaipur Foot USA's initiatives to help differently-abled people in India.Muraleedharan further added that the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic has taught the world that in an interdependent and inter-connected world, no country, rich or poor, is immune to the effects of global disasters.The Modi government has taken all necessary steps to fight the pandemic, he said.Modi's ""mantra of ‚ÄòTest, Track, Treat and Tikka', implementing various schemes for the benefit of the poor, providing foodgrains to over 80 crore people till Diwali this year, all are in line with the government's efforts to minimise the impact of the pandemic,"" he said.A Jan Ashirwaad Abhar Meeting was also organised on the occasion. Jaipur Foot USA Chairman Prem Bhandari said India, with a population of over 1.3 billion people, had a greater need for vaccines and other medicines required to deal with Covid and stop the spread of the virus.

According to the depositories' data, FPIs have pulled out Rs 1,472 crore from capital markets on a net basis in the current month so far.A trend reversal was witnessed in the debt segment in October from the big buying in the previous two months when FPIs had invested Rs 13,363 crore in September and Rs 14,376.2 crore in August. In October so far, they pulled out Rs 1,698 crore.""This trend reversal in debt investment is due to the INR depreciation in October,"" said VK Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services.In equities, FPIs invested Rs 226 crore on a net basis.""FPIs who were sellers in banking stocks in the first half of September turned buyers in the second half. But they were sellers in software services throughout September. The strong performance by IT companies like Wipro, Infosys and Mindtree is likely to attract more flows into the segment, going forward,"" he added.Himanshu Srivastava, associate director - manager research, Morningstar India said that as markets touched all-time highs and valuations soar, FPI would have preferred to stay on the sidelines, adopt a wait and watch approach and continue to book profits along the way.""There continues to be a concern among FPIs with respect to the tapering of easy liquidity after the US Fed hinted of rate hike sooner than expected. Concerns such as rising oil prices and US bond yields and challenges to the Chinese economy have also been on their radar, thus keeping them on tenterhook and preventing them from substantially investing in Indian markets,"" he added.On the future of FPI flows, Shrikant Chouhan, head - equity research (retail), Kotak Securities said that Brent crude oil prices are trading at elevated levels and a sharp increase in energy prices can be a key headwind for the equity markets.In addition, any increase in the rate by the US Fed Reserve in the near future, would also act a key headwind for overall flow in the emerging markets.

511,"With 53 road crashes per hour, road accidents in India continue to be highest in world","With 53 road crashes per hour, road accidents in India continue to be highest in world

We have known for quite some time now that the state of road safety in India is abysmal, to say the least. Come to think of it, the horrifying state of things in the context of road safety in India has been for the world to see. And now we have yet another reminder of just how deadly roads are -- this time from the World Bank. Yep, the World Bank recently released a new report that makes some interesting notes about India. For starters, the report noted that even though India is home to just 1 per cent of the world's vehicles, we still account for 11 per cent of the global road accident deaths. This is the highest in the world, by the way. It offers an even more grim number: 53 road accidents occur in India every our, killing one person every 4 minutes.

The World Bank's 2019 report, Guide for Road Safety Opportunities and Challenges: Low- and Middle-Income Countries Country Profiles, added that 13 lakh people died and another 50 lakh people have sustained injuries on Indian roads just in the last decade. Wait, there's more -- the report, factoring in the under reporting phenomenon and the crash ratios for the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways crash numbers, estimates the crashes cost the country a staggering a sum.

Road accidents in India: The cost we pay

What's even more interesting to note is that this report says the road crash and serious injury cost estimate for 2016 stood at 7.5 per cent of India's GDP or ‚Çπ12.9 lakh crore. This is more than two-folds the figure cited by the Indian government -- i.e. 3 per cent of GDP or ‚Çπ4.3 lakh crore. Speaking in the context of individuals, road accident injuries and deaths result in crippling financial burden and push non-poor households into poverty and the already poor into debt.

Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways, recently described India's road accident situation as more ""dangerous than the COVID-19 pandemic"". He added that the prevention of deaths and a reduction in injuries during road accidents can have far-reaching financial benefits as well. Gadkari said the estimated cost of a death in a road accident is about ‚Çπ91.16 lakh.","With 53 road crashes per hour, road accidents in India continue to be highest in worldWe have known for quite some time now that the state of road safety in India is abysmal, to say the least.

In total, 7,659 cases of injuries to persons were reported in 2020 as compared to 9,362 in 2019.According to Manoj Yadav , director general of police (DGP), informed that dip in road mishaps and casualties is a result of better traffic management, enhanced safety measures, improved enforcement of traffic regulations together with continuous awareness drive about road and traffic safety. However, the lockdown enforced to contain the spread of Covid-19 also contributed to a significant dip in the accidents.Giving highest priority to saving the lives of people, he said that police have provided 84 ambulances, 40 big cranes and 22 small/medium cranes in all districts for immediate first-aid to the accident victims and removal of such vehicles.

514,"For a decade, Pune rural, Nashik rural and Ahmednagar accounted for bulk of road mishaps","For a decade, Pune rural, Nashik rural and Ahmednagar have been recording the highest number of road accidents and fatalities in the state each year, data obtained from the Maharashtra Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) also known as Highway Traffic Police states.

Avinash Dhakne, the state transport commissioner, said, ‚ÄúMotorists are not disciplined and lack traffic sense. A majority of fatalities can be attributed to over-speeding, lane cutting and not wearing a helmet. The roads are getting better and so motorists tend to speed. The reason behind Nashik rural, Pune rural and Ahmednagar recording high number of accidents is because major highways pass through these three places and a lot of vehicles enter and exit Maharashtra from the north and south from these places.‚Äù

A former DCP of HSP, who did not wish to be named, said more manpower, good CCTV camera surveillance and e-challan system were needed at these places. ‚ÄúAlso, the data from FASTag and e-challans should be integrated. This way, the money can be recovered faster and motorists will desist speeding,‚Äù the former DCO said.

Harshita Jamba from WRI India, meanwhile, said standardised and accurate data of crash interventions could also lead to problem identification and evidence-based solutions.

From this year, Dhakne said, two NGOs ‚Äì Resilient India NGO and SaveLIFE Foundation ‚Äì have been roped in by the state government to help the traffic police to curb road accidents at the three places and a few other districts, which recorded a higher number of road accidents and fatalities.

So far, Resilient India has started a survey to find out the reasons behind road accidents in seven districts ‚Äì Nashik, Pune, Ahmednagar, Thane, Palghar Solapur and Dhule. The SaveLIFE Foundation, meanwhile, will be working on the National Highway 48 (Navi Mumbai to Kolhapur). Both the NGOs will carry out surveys and submit reports recommending measures that they believe will reduce road accidents.

Rajeev Choubey, risk management specialist of Resilient India said, ‚ÄúIn Nashik rural, maximum fatalities are reported on NH3 (Mumbai-Agra highway) where Vulnerable Road Users, such as two-wheeler riders, mix with fast-moving highway traffic. In Ahmednagar, we need to work on the road infrastructure. In Pune rural, maximum fatalities are at the approach periphery of the city as villages nearby are developing. Our survey has started and, in few months, we will prepare an action plan and submit it to the HSP with a focus on reducing the vulnerabilities of the motorists besides elimination/mitigation of risks associated with various hazards. We will recommend the use of CCTV surveillance at black spots.‚Äù

To curb accidents on NH48, Piyush Tewari, founder of SaveLIFE Foundation, said a lot more enforcement will be needed. ‚ÄúThe number of vehicles increases each year but the manpower of police cannot be increased in the same proportion. So, we need to use technology as much as possible to curb accidents. We are also planning to provide immediate medical help to victims of road accidents within 10 minutes of the accident or the ‚Äòplatinum 10 minutes‚Äô. We will find out how many ambulances will be needed and how to place them at strategic locations to optimise their response time,‚Äù Tewari said.","For a decade, Pune rural, Nashik rural and Ahmednagar have been recording the highest number of road accidents and fatalities in the state each year, data obtained from the Maharashtra Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) also known as Highway Traffic Police states.

517,"With single data source, India tends to underreport road crash deaths","India banks solely on police data for estimating deaths in road accidents, ignoring other critical sources, leading to a data gap that impairs its emergency response system, makes it difficult to design and implement accident prevention strategies, and

leads to an underestimation of accidental deaths, experts say.

The World Health Organization (WHO) classified India's official data on road traffic fatalities as ""unusable"" or ""unavailable"" because of ""quality issues"" in its 2019 Global Health Estimates released in December 2020. This study is still the latest available source of global data on death and disability by region, country, age, sex and cause.

In its methods and country-level data sources handbook, the WHO pointed out that it has official figures from India for only 2001-2003 and 2010-2013. For the remaining years, it has had to collate numbers from the Global Burden of Diseases(2019) study produced by its partnering institute, the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), an independent research center at the University of Washington, said a WHO statistician who did not wish to be named.



The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH)'s data on road crash deaths are not complete because the data reporting process of the police departments is flawed, there is significant underreporting especially in rural India, and not enough public trust in the police, experts told IndiaSpend.



The WHO classifies all countries into four categories on the basis of data availability on the cause of death: ""high completeness"", ""low completeness and/or issues with cause-of-death assignment"", ""low completeness with severe quality issues"" and ""data are unavailable"".



In the case of road deaths, for example, Japan is listed in the ""high completeness"" category and Thailand in ""low completeness"", while India's numbers are categorised as ""data are unavailable"". While Japan collates road deaths data from sources such as hospitals, ambulance services, forensic investigation of crash sites and insurance providers, Thailandbanks on its ministries of public health, interior and transport and so on for estimates.



However, this gap is normal because the WHO and the Indian government use different methods to collect numbers and it is difficult to prove which method is more robust, Anshuman Mohanty, economic advisor, Transport Research Wing, MoRTH, told IndiaSpend.



A comprehensive crash investigation system is required to offer every stakeholder--the public, the police and policy makers--strong evidence on the contributing factors, wrote Benedicta Isaac-Kumar, a consultant with Chennai-based Citizen consumer and civic Action Group, a non-profit, voluntary and professional citizens group.



Why police data are incomplete



In India, there are two reports on data relating to road traffic accidents--the 'Road Accidents in India' report of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and the 'Crime in India' report of the Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). As in many countries, the data are sourced entirely from the police departments of states and union territories.



Here is how the police collect crash information. Once they are informed about a by someone involved in the mishap, a witness or a police officer at the site, a First Information Report (FIR) is recorded.Its content can only be changed with the permission of the High Court or the Supreme Court of India, explains a 2020 Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT-Delhi) study. Once the investigation concludes, a case file is prepared. After this, the offending party is charged under provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Motor Vehicles Act of India 1988.



In the case of serious injuries and instantaneous death, the survivor or the victim's family may file an FIR only if they want to pursue the case in a court or claim compensation, insurance after adjudication by the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal.



The IIT study also reported that most cases are attributed to ""human error"" and this means that factors such as vehicular and infrastructural problems are not included. The cause of the crash has to be recorded as the ""fault"" of a ""road user"" as per the India Penal Code (IPC) and Motor Vehicle Act 1988, ignoring all other factors.



On the shortcomings of the data reporting mechanism in India, the MoRTH report itself pointed out that if a victim dies in a hospital after 30 days of the accident, it is not reported as a road traffic fatality.



""Collecting data from different sources to build meaningful analysis of road crashes is vital,"" said Piyush Tewari, founder of the New Delhi-based SaveLIFE Foundation (SLF), an independent non-profit organisation focussed on improving road safety and emergency medical care. ""For example, data can be collected from police officials, ambulance service providers, information from bystanders etc.""



""We don't have any trauma registry database where hospitals need to report deaths or injuries, like now all hospitals need to report Covid-19 cases on a central portal,"" M.C. Misra, the former director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), told IndiaSpend.



Underreporting of deaths



Due to the inadequate police presence in India's rural areas, it is possible that about 50% of road crash deaths there go unreported, said the IIT study. For urban pockets, this figure is lower but still significant, 10-20%. In urban areas, most of the road accident deaths and injuries get reported which occur in a hospital. Due to the sparse density of hospitals in rural areas, the chances of missing accidents, deaths and injuries are higher.



Data on non-fatal crash injuries in India may also be unreliable because survivors may choose not to report them to the police or hospitals, the IIT Delhi study noted.



Lack of trust, bias



Road traffic accidents and injuries go unreported because of entrenched biases among both the police and civilians. Accident survivors in India are reluctant to report cases because they believe the police to be apathetic and also because they do not want to be caught up in lengthy police procedures, especially in rural areas, said G. Gururaj, former director of the Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS). He pointed to the fact that in rural areas, an accident victim is first cremated and then the case reported to the police.



When accidents occur, police officials tend to assume that drivers of large vehicles such as truck drivers are at fault, ignoring the conditions of the vehicle, fatigue among drivers, road conditions, and so on, said Tewari of SLF, adding that this is why truck drivers tend not to report accidents. About 40% of respondents in the 2020 SLF survey on truck drivers said they were dissatisfied with their jobs because of harassment from the police, the transport authorities and local residents.

Skewed distribution of traffic resources



Police departments are also stretched for human and other resources. About 27% of the vacancies in traffic police departments across India have yet to be filled, according to the 2020 Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) report on 'Data on Police Organizations'. Eight states--Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat, Telangana, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar--have more than 40% of posts waiting to be filled in their traffic police forces. Among them, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Gujarat appear in the top 10 list of most number of road accidents in India in 2019, per MoRTH report.



The deployment of traffic constables and head constables in states does not align with the vehicular density of states. An average 26% of posts lie unfilled in the traffic police departments of 10 states with the most vehicular density, shows a combined analysis of the MoRTH's 2017-18 and 2018-19 Road Transport Year Book report and the BPR&D report.

Finding solutions



To allow the data on road accidents to be more robust, the government introduced the 2019 Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act (MVAA). It aimed to enable officials to investigate road crashes for better and more comprehensive data.



The government also launched the Integrated Road Accident Database (iRAD) project. The iRAD is a central accident database management system launched in January 2020 that connects information from multiple sources--hospitals, ambulance services, blood banks, insurance companies, and so on. It was deployed for ""live accident data entry"" in six states--Maharashtra,



Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu--in February 2021. Its data processing mechanism was still in progress as of March 18, 2021, Gadkari said responding to a question during the March 2021 parliament session.

The SLF has started training traffic police in India's 15 most accident-prone states, including Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Delhi, Telangana, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Chattisgarh. The Uttar Pradesh police have started conducting forensic investigations for road crashes on the Yamuna Expressway in collaboration with the SaveLIFE Foundation.



However, data integration is challenging in India because it is ""a poor country"" with ""a lot of diversity"", Mohanty, economic advisor, Transport Research Wing, MoRTH, told IndiaSpend. ""I don't have any update on the implementation of iRAD in India. I have to check,"" he added.



Case study: Why data is critical



In 2016, the SLF collaborated with the Maharashtra government on a Zero Fatality Corridor (ZFC) project on the 95.4-km Mumbai-Pune Expressway (MPEW), aiming to create a safety model that could be replicated across roads in India. They looked for solutions in four areas commonly stated as ""4 E's of Road Safety"": engineering, emergency care, enforcement and engagement.



The project undertook various initiatives--issued 46,563 challans using speed-traps, installed Vehicle Activated Speed Sign (VASS) to alert motorists about speeding and barricaded 10,300 parked or stalled vehicles to prevent rear-end collisions.



As a part of the initiative, around 150 km of Tactile Edge Lines--yellow road tiles to indicate hazards and the direction of travel--were installed on the highway to address fatigue-related crashes. The project also pinpointed 15 types of road engineering errors--poorly designed slopes and lack of siding space for trucks on uphill tracts--which had been repeated 2,145 times across the two corridors of the highway. Later, these engineering errors were rectified by the SLF in collaboration with the state government.



The SLF also developed a 'Chain of Survival' initiative consisting of on-ground, ambulance and in-hospital care services for road accident victims.



This model helped slash the number of road crash fatalities on the MPEW by 43% between 2016 and 2021--the numbers fell from 151 to 86. Replication of this model, the use of data science and forensic investigation--all these can make Indian roads safer, said Tewari of SLF.","Why police data are incompleteIn India, there are two reports on data relating to road traffic accidents--the 'Road Accidents in India' report of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and the 'Crime in India' report of the Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).

518,Road accidents can be reduced,"Public discourse, improving infrastructure can help

Fifty-one passengers of an overcrowded bus died in an accident on the morning of February 16 when it fell into a canal near Sarda Patan village in Sidhi district, Madhya Pradesh. A griha pravesh (house-warming) ceremony for the beneficiaries of one lakh houses constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana in Bhopal, which was to be attended virtually by Union Home Minister Amit Shah, was cancelled due to the incident. Two days earlier, fourteen persons were killed when a minivan they were travelling in hit a divider on a National Highway (NH) near Madarpur village in Kurnool district, Andhra Pradesh. The van carrying 18 passengers was on its way to Ajmer in Rajasthan from Chittoor, when the driver lost control and hit the divider, tumbling on the other side of the road where a speeding truck crashed into it.

According to a study conducted by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, 1,51,113 persons were killed and 4,51,361 injured in road accidents across the country in 2019. NHs and State Highways, which account for about 5% of the total road length, claimed 61% of the deaths related to accidents. Around 35,606 deaths were reported on the NHs, which come under the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).

Speaking at a webinar organised by the International Road Federation on February 9, Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said India topped the fatality figures in road accidents in the world, with 415 deaths each day. While commending Tamil Nadu for taking effective road safety measures that had resulted in the reduction of road accidents by 38% and deaths by 54%, he asked other States to emulate Tamil Nadu.

It is small wonder that he actively pursued the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, with the well-intentioned motive of bringing down the death rate due to road accidents by 50% by 2020. This was agreed to by all participating nations in the United Nations Brasilia Declaration, of which India was a signatory. Though the number of deaths due to accidents declined to 1.20 lakh in 2020 due to COVID-19, Mr. Gadkari shifted the deadline to 2025.

But the steep hike in the fines imposed for traffic violations in the Act was met with stiff opposition, with some States dismissing it as too harsh and, hence, not willing to implement it. What seems to have been ignored while drafting the law was the fact that a good number of those driving vehicles to earn their livelihood were from economically poor backgrounds. West Bengal decided not to implement the new law and continued with the West Bengal Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989.

The Madras High Court recently struck down the April 6, 2018 notification of the Union Government wherein the speed limit was hiked to 120 and 100 km/hour on expressways and highways, respectively. This was done as 66.7% of accidents was attributed to overspeeding in 2017, 55.73% in 2018 and 64.4% in 2019.

Studies carried out by various organisations have also come out with the causes for accidents and ways to curb them. The Accident Research Cell of the Delhi Traffic Police carried out an analysis of accidents and created a database that facilitates the formulation of policies to prevent accidents. While probing an accident that led to the death of former Union Rural Development Minister Gopinath Munde in New Delhi, the cell concluded that hedges along a road obstructed the visibility of drivers coming from the other direction. After the hedges were pruned, the stretch became free from accidents.

While the strict enforcement of traffic safety laws would go a long way, educating citizens about the impact of accidents on the kin of the victims through public discourse could help in reducing accidents. Improving road infrastructure with coordinated efforts by the police and civic authorities, identification of black spots that are prone to accidents and deploying an adequate number of police personnel, particularly during peak hours, could bring down accident rates. Highway patrols with police personnel trained in first aid and ambulances every 10 km could also help save precious lives.

519,India loses 1.5 lakh lives due to road accidents every year; here is how most of them can be saved,"While India accounts for about 1% of motor vehicles globally, it records more than 11% of road traffic deaths

Every year, the lives of 1.3 million people are cut short due to road accidents. In India itself, around 150,000 people lose their lives on roads every year. While India accounts for about 1 percent of motor vehicles globally, it records more than 11 percent of road traffic deaths.

In the past few years, countries like Sweden, Australia and the United Kingdom have improved their road safety outcomes through effective central legislation. India too enacted the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act, 2019. It was the result of a five-year effort to improve national legislation on road safety. The enactment of the new legislation is a positive step; however, even after two years, the situation on the ground has not improved much.

While implementation of the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act 2019 needs to be done on a priority basis, this article highlights three additional steps to be undertaken to improve road safety in our country.

Adopting the safe system approach

Traditionally, road safety interventions have revolved around modifying human behaviour to prevent road crashes. However, the safe system approach hinges on the principle that human beings will make mistakes, and the risk of these mistakes should not result in a fatality or a serious injury.

Today, city agencies are more concerned with moving motor vehicles as quickly as possible, even at the cost of risking the lives of pedestrians and cyclists. About 90 percentof the pedestrian deaths recorded in Gurugram in 2020 occurred on national highways, state highways or expressways, all high-speed corridors.

It is essential that speed along these corridors, especially at the intersection, needs to be brought down to a safe limit, which can be accomplished with a good design. However, any efforts to increase speed will only lead to an increase in traffic crashes, especially those involving vulnerable road users.

Importance of ‚Äòsafer‚Äô infrastructure

Traditionally, the 5Es of road safety involves ‚Äî Education, Encouragement, Enforcement, Evaluation, and Engineering. Most often, education is the first E, and the last E is engineering.

Yes, road safety education is essential, but empirical studies from around the world have shown that ‚Äòeducation‚Äô alone does not improve road safety. What is needed is safe infrastructure and safe vehicles, in addition to road users, who follow safety rules.

However, ‚Äòroad safety‚Äô dialogues in India still do not highlight the importance of safer roads.

The starting point of creating safer roads is by collecting data on road traffic crashes and geocoding the location of these crashes. The analysis of this data will help identify high-risk roads and sites, also called ‚Äúblackspots‚Äù and improving the infrastructure of these locations will improve overall safety. Also, road safety audits and inspection of existing and new roads will ensure a gradual decrease in ‚Äúblackspots‚Äù.

Managing speeds

Managing speed to improve safety does not come naturally to us. That is because we have still not understood the impact of speed, especially in areas where highways and other high-speed corridors interact with pedestrians and slow-moving traffic.

For example, if a pedestrian is hit by a car at 30 kmph, their chance of survival is 90 percent. However, if the same collision occurs at 50 kmph, which is the legal speed limit, the likelihood is only 15 percent.

India is a signatory to the Stockholm Declaration of 2020. The biggest and the boldest recommendation from the Stockholm Declaration is on speed. The declaration asks members to mandate a maximum travel speed of 30 km/h in areas where non-motorised road users and motor vehicles mix frequently. It means that the streets inside the city need to be designed and enforced for a maximum speed of 30 km/h or less. Reducing speed, in general, also has a positive impact on air quality and climate change and reduces road traffic deaths and injuries.

Road traffic crashes are an epidemic in India. It is not only a public health issue but an economic one. The country loses $58 billion, or 3 percent of its GDP, every year due to road traffic crashes. The COVID-19 crisis did halt the mobility, but things are improving, and the country is moving towards a post-Covid scenario.

Therefore, it needs to build back better, which would be impossible without addressing the critical issue of road safety. After all, the benefits of improving road safety go far beyond increasing the overall quality of life for India‚Äôs citizens and will undoubtedly save many lives.

As per a recent notification by the road ministry, anyone who saves the life of a road accident victim by rushing them to a hospital within the ‚Äògolden hour‚Äô will be rewarded Rs 5,000 for their effort.

The Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has issued guidelines for the scheme, which will be in place from 15 October 2021 till 31 March, 2026.

The government has been implementing several plans to make the country‚Äôs roads safe for travelling.

Road accidents in India

A report, titled Guide for Road Safety Opportunities and Challenges: Low- and Middle-Income Countries Country Profiles, by the World Bank revealed that with only one percent of the world's vehicles, India accounted for 11 percent of the global death in road accidents, the highest in the world in 2019.

Data showed that the country accounts for about 4.5 lakh road crashes per annum, in which 1.5 lakh people die. The report further stated that India witnessed 53 road crashes every hour; killing one person every four minutes.

The road ministry also stated that 76.2 percent of people who died in road crashes are in the age group of 18-45 years.

The situation is so dire in the nation that Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Nitin Gakdari had been quoted as saying that the road accident scenario in India was more ""dangerous than the COVID-19 pandemic"".

A recent study commissioned by MoRTH estimated the socio-economic costs of road crashes at Rs 1,47,114 crore in India, which is equivalent to 0.77 percent of the country's GDP.

Brasilia Declaration on Road Safety

Taking into consideration the high number of deaths on roads across the globe, in 2015, the World Health Organisation came up with the Brasilia Declaration, which called out for stringent traffic laws to prevent accidents.

In the declaration, participating countries asserted their commitment to reducing the deaths caused due to traffic accidents to half by the year 2020. This target was set under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. India adopted the same in 2015, with Nitin Gadkari signing it on behalf of India at the 2nd High Level Global Conference.

However, India hasn't been able to achieve the goal of cutting road death rates by 50 percent. Gadkari said that a total of 366,138 road accidents occurred in India during the calendar year 2020, a drop from the 4,37,396 road accident cases in 2019.

Similarly deaths have also reduced with India reporting 1,31,714 deaths in 2020 compared to 1,54,732 in 2019.

Motor Vehicles Amendment Act, 2019

Another way the government has tried to reduce road deaths is by implementing the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act, 2019.

The legislation increased the penalties for traffic violations, defective vehicles and juvenile driving.

It also provides for a Motor Vehicle Accident Fund, which would provide compulsory insurance cover to all road users in India for certain types of accidents.

When introduced in September 2019, many had criticised it saying that the amendment to the law was solely done to earn money from traffic violations. However, defending the move, Nitin Gadkari had reiterated that the idea of increasing the penalty against the violators was not to earn money but to save the life of many stakeholders who could be involved in road traffic accidents.

In fact, Nitin Gadkari told the Lok Sabha in November 2019 that road accidents and fatalities reduced nine percent in at least nine states after the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 came into effect from 1 September 2019.

During September-October 2019, 3,375 people died in road accidents in comparison to 3,729 deaths during the same period in 2018.

Moreover, the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 had also inserted a new section 134A for the protection of good Samaritans who come to the aid of road accident victims.

The rules provided for the Rights of Good Samaritan, which include that the person shall be treated respectfully without any discrimination on the grounds of religion, nationality, caste or sex.

The rule also stated that every public and private hospital shall publish a charter in Hindi, English and vernacular language, at the entrance or other conspicuous location and on their website, stating the rights of good Samaritans under the Act and the rules made thereunder.

And on 5 October, the government said that a good Samaritan would be given a cash award of Rs 5,000 if he rushed a road accident victim to the hospital within the 'golden hour' of the mishap.

For those who don't know, the 'Golden hour' refers to the one-hour time period following a traumatic injury during which there is the highest likelihood of preventing death by providing prompt medical care.

Better roads

Other than the new legislation, the government has also acknowledged the role that the quality of roads play in accidents.

As one can imagine, faulty roads are accident-prone and curves on roads and potholes are contributing factors to road accidents.

The Road Accidents in India 2018 report by MoRTH showed that roads with sharp curves, potholes and steep gradients tend to be more accident-prone because successfully negotiating them requires skill, extra care and alertness.

Additionally, speeding on highways is another reason for accidents.

KK Kapila, President Emeritus of International Road Federation was quoted as telling Deccan Herald, ""Accidents are caused due to the tendency to over-speed on the good quality of Expressways and Highways wherein the safety parameters are often compromised to reduce costs.""

Road discipline

Road discipline is one thing that is lacking among drivers, which leads to accidents and fatalities.

Drivers and two-wheeler users often are found not wearing seatbelts and helmets respectively.

For this, the government has carried out several public service announcements, emphasising the importance of both and also imposed heavy fines for those who don't comply.

Nitin Gadkari hopes that reduction deaths in road accidents to go down by 50 percent before 2025. He had also said that if ""we keep waiting till 2030, then at least six-seven lakh people will die more due to road accidents"".

Will we be able to achieve this goal? Let's hope so!

Rail accidents

Meanwhile, 52 cases of deaths due to negligence related to rail accidents were recorded across the country in 2020; 55 such cases in 2019 and 35 in 2018, the report showed.

Earlier this year, Union minister Nitin Gadkari had said that the road accident scenario in India was more ""dangerous than COVID-19 pandemic"".

In February 2021, Gadkari had said there could be a saving of Rs 90 lakh per person by preventing deaths and reducing injuries to minor ones in such incidents.

The Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) is all set to roll out a new Rs 7,270 crore State Support Programme for Strengthening Road Safety to help realise the vision of ‚ÄúZero road fatalities on Indian roads.‚Äù

The centrally-sponsored six-year programme will be implemented in 14 states that are now contributing to 85 per cent of the total road fatalities in the country.

While MoRTH will lend a budgetary support of Rs 3,635 crore, an amount of Rs 1,818 crore will be secured as loan each from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

Of the total cost, Rs 6,725 crore will be disbursed to the 14 states based on their performance while MoRTH will use Rs 545 crore for capacity building activities.

The scheme will incentivise state governments to drive road safety interventions at the grassroots level with the main objective of curbing road accidents and achieving a reduction in fatalities, the MoRTH said in a concept note circulated to the target states.

The target states under the scheme are Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Bihar, Telangana, West Bengal, Odisha, Haryana and Assam.

""This is an output and outcome-driven scheme wherein the performance of the states will be assessed on 11 mandatory and three elective indicators (road safety interventions). The grants will be distributed to the states based on the Key Performance Indicators,"" top official sources told PTI.

The preliminary project report prepared by MoRTH says the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act (2019) was brought in as an important intervention to achieve the fatality reduction target.

""To leverage the strengthened law, it is necessary to have focused interventions in the related areas of road safety like road engineering, enforcement, road safety advocacy and media campaigns and efficient emergency response systems. The states need to be supported to act on result-oriented strategies. Hence the new scheme,"" the sources said.

India reported about 1.51 lakh road deaths in 4.49 lakh accidents in the year 2019. Of the total deaths, the 14 identified states accounted for 1,27,379.

The number of fatalities remained consistent over the last five years.

In 2020, 1.32 lakh road deaths were recorded across the country, with the Covid-19-induced lockdown resulting in the reduction in number.

The new scheme targets to reduce the fatality rate by 30 per cent by March 2027.

Cyclists, two and three-wheeler riders and pedestrians have been identified as ‚Äúvulnerable road users‚Äù who comprised about 54 per cent of road traffic deaths in India.

Under the new scheme, performance-based indicators have been proposed with the aim of reducing the impact of road accidents on these vulnerable users.

An Integrated Road Accident Database (IRAD) will be rolled out in all states by 2022-23 and applied for identifying and rectifying all black spots on state highways and major district roads.

Road safety audit will be made mandatory on state highways and urban roads by the end of the scheme period.

From 2022-23, MoRTH will launch a ‚ÄúChallenge Round‚Äù every year to provide incentives to states on additional road safety interventions and also to promote competition among states.

""The grant of Rs 7,270 crore will only meet partial fund requirement for the scheme. States are expected to make their own budgetary allocations and also implement projects in Public-Private Partnership mode,"" MoRTH told the states.

Independent Verification Agencies will scrutinise the states' achievements, based on which the Central grant will be released.

Some of the other major interventions mooted under the scheme are: Installation of speed management devices on urban roads in cities with a population of over four lakh, state highways and national highways for increased enforcement, a unique number for reporting accidents, development of dedicated lanes for two-wheelers on state highways and urban roads and identification of priority corridors.

State Education Boards will be required to introduce a chapter on road safety for classes 6-9 in 2022-23 and up to class-12 the next year on.

Deployment of Advance Traffic Management System, campaigns on vehicle safety and driver training, establishment of a Command and Control (Data) Centre for ambulances, establishment of automated vehicle fitness centres are some of the other initiatives planned under the scheme.","State Support Programme for Strengthening Road Safety will be implemented in 14 states that make up 85 per cent of the total road fatalities in the country.

530,"Jagran Explainer | Fixed driving hours, sleep detection sensor: Nitin Gadkari's proposed plan aims to reduce road accidents in India","New Delhi | Jagran News Desk: Road accidents are one of the common problems in India. With only 1 per cent of the world's vehicles, India accounts for 11 per cent of the global death in road accidents, the highest in the world, according to a report by the World Bank. Accidents by truck drivers constitute a large part of this logistics. Over-speeding, fatigue, and sleepiness are the major causes of road crashes by truck drivers in India.

In a bid to reduce road accidents and give relief to truck drivers, Union Minister for Road Transport Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday called for fixed driving hours for truck drivers. He also directed that trucks should be fixed with onboard sleep detection sensors at par with European standards to achieve this purpose.

Measures suggested by Gadkari to reduce road accidents:

Presiding over a meeting of the National Road Safety Council (NRSC), Gadkari said that just like pilots have fixed flying hours, drivers of commercial trucks - a segment of vehicles that forms a major part of highway traffic ‚Äì should have fixed driving hours, to reduce driving fatigue.

He also directed NRSC authorities that commercial vehicles should have onboard sleep detection sensors and sought timely updates on the matter after every two months.

""Have directed officers to work on a policy to include On-Board Sleep Detection Sensors in Commercial Vehicles, at par with European standards,"" Gadkari said in a tweet.

What is sleep detection sensor?

A sleep detection sensor is a car safety technology that helps to prevent accidents when the driver gets drowsy. It sets a sleep alarm in the vehicle for detecting the condition indicative of the onset of sleepiness. For example, an eye blink sensor is used to keep track of the driver‚Äôs eyelid motion. Similarly, a vibrating device is incorporated within the driver‚Äôs seat which gets activated when the conditions are not satisfied. Sleep detection sensors are widely used in European countries in vehicles, particularly commercial vehicles, to avoid road accidents. In India, the system is still not very popular.

Road accidents in India:

According to the World Bank report, India accounts for about 4.5 lakh road crashes per annum, of which 1.5 lakh people die. Every hour 53 road crashes occur; killing 1 person every 4 minutes. In the last decade, 13 lakh people died and another 50 lakh got injured on Indian roads.

A recent study commissioned by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) estimates the socio-economic costs of road crashes at Rs 1,47,114 crore in India, which is equivalent to 0.77 per cent of the country's GDP.

At the individual level, road crash injuries and deaths impose a severe financial burden and push entire (non-poor) households into poverty and the already poor into debt.

531,Good Samaritan scheme comes into force in Madhya Pradesh,"Under the ‚ÄúGood Samaritan Scheme,‚Äô any person who saves the life of a victim of a road accident by rushing him to a hospital or a trauma centre would be rewarded with ‚Çπ5,000.

A Central scheme aimed at bringing down the fatalities in road accidents by rewarding Good Samaritans who rush the victims to a hospital within the ‚Äúgolden hour‚Äù has come into force in Madhya Pradesh, a senior official said on Saturday.

Under the ‚ÄúGood Samaritan Scheme,‚Äô any person who saves the life of a victim of a road accident by rushing him to a hospital or a trauma centre would be rewarded with ‚Çπ5,000.

‚ÄúThe Centre‚Äôs Good Samaritan Scheme has come into effect on the day of Dussehra (October 15) in Madhya Pradesh‚Äô‚Äô, State Traffic and Road Safety Additional Director General of Police (ADG) G. Janardhan told PTI on Saturday.

He said the scheme was aimed at motivating the general public to help the victims of road accidents in emergencies and inspire and motivate others to save innocent lives.

In August, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways informed Parliament that a total of 3,66,138 road accidents occurred in India during the calendar year 2020, causing 1,31,714 deaths.

The ADG said a Good Samaritan is eligible for the cash prize in case the road accident victim sustains brain, spinal cord injuries or is admitted to the hospital for a minimum of three days or undergoes major surgery.

Janardhan, who is also ADG, M.P. Police Training and Research Institute (PTRI), said that each Good Samaritan would also receive a certificate of appreciation along with ‚Çπ5,000 in cash for saving the life of a road accident victim.

An individual could be awarded a maximum of five times in a year, he said.

The senior official stressed that the details provided by the person who saves the life of a road accident victim will be used for giving incentives and they won‚Äôt be used anywhere else.

Explaining the procedure, Janardhan said after a Good Samaritan rushes the victim to the hospital or trauma centre, the doctor concerned will inform the police. Police will write down the details of him in a format and forward it to that district appraisal committee, comprising collector, superintendent of police, chief medical and health officer and Regional Transport Officer (RTO) which will scrutinise the cases and clear the reward.

Asked about the golden hour, the senior police officer said, ‚Äú As per the Motor Vehicle Act‚Äôs Section 2 (12 A), it (golden hour) means the period lasting one hour following a traumatic injury during which there is the highest likelihood of preventing death by providing prompt medical care‚Äù.

In the event of two people saving the life of a road accident victim, the ‚Çπ5,000 reward under this scheme will be divided between them, he said.

‚ÄúIf more than one Good Samaritan saves the life of more than one victim of a fatal accident involving a motor vehicle, the amount of award will be ‚Çπ5,000 per victim saved subject to maximum ‚Çπ5,000 per Good Samaritan,‚Äù he said quoting the circular.

Janardhan further said the State-level appraisal committee comprises the Home Department Additional Chief Secretary, Health Secretary and M.P. Transport Commissioner besides ADG Traffic & Road safety.

He said there will be ten national-level awards each year for the worthiest Good Samaritans who will be selected from all those who have been awarded during the entire year and they would additionally be given an award of ‚Çπ1 lakh each, a letter of appreciation and a trophy.","Under the ‚ÄúGood Samaritan Scheme,‚Äô any person who saves the life of a victim of a road accident by rushing him to a hospital or a trauma centre would be rewarded with ‚Çπ5,000.

India's pursuit of the 'zero road accident deaths' goal has typically been pushed around and delayed without a second thought. It is surprising because it is not solely a goal the country's government set out for itself on its own; it is in fact, a global committment India made. Anyway, we will save the rant for another day; for now, let us focus on the fact that pursuit of the aforementioned zero road accident deaths in India is set to see the addition of a new programme with an investment of whopping ‚Çπ7,270 crore. Yep, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) will soon roll out a new 'State Support Programme for Strengthening Road Safety' to empower different states across the country to achieve the goal of 'zero road accident fatalities'.

According to a PTI report, this Centre-sponsored six-year programme will be implemented across 14 states which account for 85 per cent of the total road accident deaths in India. The new scheme will involve evaluation on the basis of performance-based indicators and states' achievements will be evaluated by independent verification agencies. Based on the reports of these agence, the Central grant will be released to the states.

The report notes that by the end of the scheme's period, road safety audits on state highways as well as urban roads will be made mandatory. The following states will be targetted under this new road safety scheme:

Uttar Pradesh

Maharashtra

Madhya Pradesh

Karnataka

Rajasthan

Tamil Nadu

Andhra Pradesh

Gujarat

Bihar

Telangana

West Bengal

Odisha

Haryana

The Delhi Traffic Police is switching gears on how to deal with road accidents in the city, with a list of ‚Äúmost unsafe drivers‚Äù -- 100 habitual offenders who will be issued a warning for imperilling their own and other commuters' lives by violating traffic rules.

In a first of its kind exercise, Delhi Traffic Police is compiling a list of repeat offenders who have been fined multiple times but keep breaking traffic rules regardless. The goal is to create a more concrete structure to make people aware of road safety, Special Commissioner of Police Muktesh Chander (Traffic) told Indian Express.

The list of 100 ‚Äúmost unsafe drivers‚Äù will help the Traffic Police to identify and keep track of habitual offenders, much as criminals with a record of murder and other heinous crimes are tagged as history-sheeters, explained Special Commissioner Chander.

The process to create this list of traffic offenders is currently underway. Police are tapping into the e-challans database to round up people who have the maximum number of cases in red-light jumping, speeding, rash driving and accidents.

‚ÄúOnce we have 100 names, we will start sending them notices at their residence,‚Äù said the police.

With a focus on correction, police will ask the offenders on the list to join road safety classes. In case people don‚Äôt show up or continue to break traffic norms, action will be taken against them.

‚ÄúWe will tell them that their driving is dangerous for pedestrians and for themselves. It will be a request for cooperation but we can also exercise our right to report to transport authorities. their licence can be suspended or cancelled,‚Äù said Special Commissioner Chander.

Currently, a little over 400 people die every day in India due to road accidents. India also records around 1.5 lakh deaths in five lakh road crashes annually. Nitin Gadkari had listed this record as one of the biggest failures of his ministry in the last seven years.

Gadkari laid emphasis on road quality and safety measures on Indian roads to bring down the figures. His ministry is actively working to reduce black spots from Indian roads. Gadkari pointed out that around 50 per cent of road accidents are due to road engineering problems.

Gadkari said his ministry is striving hard to reduce road accident deaths by restructuring and strengthening four 'Es' of road safety -- Engineering (including road and automobile engineering), Economy, Enforcement and Education.

Gadkari also said that insurance companies need to cooperate more with respect to road safety activities to help the ministry to bring down casualties in road crashes. ""Insurance companies are direct beneficiaries of a saved life. Hence, they can extend their cooperation for various road safety activities... but the cooperation from the insurance companies is very negligible, and cooperation from government insurance companies is zero,"" he said.

Gadkari said that there is a shortage of 22 lakh drivers across the country. This has prompted the government to plan 2,000 driving schools, especially in backward districts.","Similar BikesNitin Gadkari's remarks come months after he said that he hopes reduction in deaths in road accidents to go down by 50% before 2025.

540,India's journey from recognizing the 'Good Samaritan' to extending rights and now a cash award,"The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) recently issued guidelines for a new scheme to extend cash award of Rs. 5,000 to the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô who provides emergency assistance to victims of fatal accidents. Here is a review of India‚Äôs journey from recognizing the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô to extending them rights and now a cash award.

Injuries in road accidents are among the top 10 causes of deaths globally. In 2019, over 4.49 lakh road accidents were reported in India and over 1.51 lakh persons lost their lives in these accidents. Between 2010 and 2019, a total of 14.4 lakh deaths have been reported due to road accidents in the country.

India ranks first in terms of the absolute number of deaths in road accidents among 199 countries, and deaths due to road accidents in India alone account for 11% of the accident-related deaths in the world. In India, road injuries are the leading cause of death among young adult males. With increasing vehicle population and vehicle density on roads, the probability of accidents & deaths due to them is more than before.

50% of the fatalities in road accidents could have been averted if prompt medical service was given

One major reason for the high fatalities in road accidents is the lack of timely medical treatment for victims. According to a 2006 report of the Law Commission of India, 50% of the fatalities could have been averted if victims were admitted to a hospital within the first one hour, which is called the golden hour. Lives could be saved if emergency medical treatment is provided immediately. Unfortunately, many bystanders and passers-by are hesitant to help the injured accident victims because of the fear of police harassment, detention at hospitals, and prolonged legal formalities. To encourage people to come forward and render help to the accident victims, legal protection, and perks for ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô are necessary.

A ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô is a person who, in good faith, without expectation of payment or reward and without any duty of care or special relationship, voluntarily comes forward to administer immediate assistance or emergency care to a person injured in an accident, or crash, or emergency medical condition, or emergency situation. A ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô law is supposed to safeguard such individuals from harassment & legal hassles they may have to undergo for saving the lives of victims.

PIL in 2012 brought attention to the issue of protecting ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô

A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed in the Supreme Court in 2012 requesting the Court to safeguard ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô who come forward to help the injured, paved the way for legal protection and encouragement of ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô. Following the apex court‚Äôs orders, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), in 2015, notified guidelines about the protection of ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô as an interim measure until appropriate legislation is made by the Union government. Later in 2016, MoRTH issued a Standard Operating Procedure for the examination of ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô during the trial.

Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 included provisions for ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô in legislation

A new section 134A titled ‚ÄòProtection of Good Samaritans‚Äô was inserted through the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, which provides that ‚Äòa Good Samaritan shall not be liable for any civil or criminal action for any injury to or death of the victim of an accident involving a motor vehicle, where such injury or death resulted from the Good Samaritan‚Äôs negligence in acting or failing to act while rendering emergency medical or non-medical care or assistance and that the Central Government may by rules provide for the procedure for questioning or examination of the Good Samaritan, disclosure of personal information of the Good Samaritan and such other related matters.‚Äô

In 2020, MoRTH published relevant rules laying down the ‚ÄòRights of Good Samaritan‚Äô. The rules make it clear that it is the voluntary choice of the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô to disclose his/her name, identity, address or any such other personal details and no police officer or any other person shall compel a ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô to do so.

The scheme for awarding ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô was recently announced by MoRTH

On 05 October 2021, MoRTH issued guidelines for the ‚ÄòScheme for grand of award to the Good Samaritan‚Äô, to motivate the general public to help the road accident victims in emergency situations. The scheme will be effective from 15 October 2021 and operational until 31 March 2026.

Under the scheme, any individual who has saved the life of a victim of a fatal accident involving a motor vehicle by administering immediate assistance and rushing to a hospital within the ‚ÄòGolden Hour‚Äô of the accident to provide medical treatment would be eligible for a cash award and certificate of appreciation for their good deed. Golden hour is defined as the period of an hour post a traumatic injury during which the likelihood of preventing death by giving immediate medical care is the highest. A fatal accident is one which leads to a major surgery, brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, or at least 3 days of hospitalization.

Each ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô will be given a cash award and certificate

As per the guidelines, each ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô, subject to the eligibility criteria, will be given a cash award of Rs. 5,000 per incident. That is, even if they save the lives of more than one person in a single incident, they will be eligible for a cash award of Rs. 5,000 only. If more than one ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô saves the life of a victim, then the Rs. 5,000 cash awards will be split equally among them. If more than one ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô saves the life of more than one victim of an accident, then they will be given a cash award of Rs. 5,000 per victim saved subject to a maximum award of Rs. 5,000 per ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô. Further, an individual ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô can be awarded a maximum of five times in a year.

Ten worthiest ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô in the country will be awarded Rs. 1 lakh, certificate, and trophy

Apart from the cash award, a ‚ÄòCertification of Appreciation‚Äô will also be provided to the ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô. Additionally, the scheme has also announced the presentation of 10 national-level awards to be handed out annually for the worthiest ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô among those who have been awarded the whole year. The national-level award winners will get a cash award of Rs. 1 lakh each along with a Certificate and trophy during National Road Safety Month (NRSM) in Delhi.

What is the procedure to identify & award the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô?

When the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô informs the police first about the accident, the police upon receiving the required details from the Doctor will provide an acknowledgement to the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô on the official letter pad. The acknowledgement would contain details such as name, phone number, and address of the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô, details of the accident such as time, place, and date, and how the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô helped in saving the life of a victim. If the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô takes the victim to the hospital first, then the hospital must provide all the details to the concerned police station, and the police must provide an acknowledgement to the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô. The standard format for acknowledgement is provided in the guidelines.

Committees at the District, State, and National level will be set up for award purpose

A copy of the acknowledgement provided by the police is sent to the District Level Appraisal Committee comprising of District Magistrate, Chief Medical and Health Officer, RTO, and SSP. The committee will review and approve the proposals on a monthly basis. The cases are then sent to the concerned State/UT Transport Department for making the payment to the Good Samaritans. For the national-level awards, the State level committee of each State/UT must nominate the three most worthy proposals on a yearly basis. An Appraisal Committee of the MoRTH would review the proposals received from the States/UTs and select the best ten ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô of the year.

An initial grant of Rs. 5 Lakhs will be provided by MoRTH to the Transport Department of the State/UT for making payment to the ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô which would be reimbursed by the Ministry on monthly basis. A separate account is to be created for this purpose.

Different types of ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô laws exist across the World

In countries like the United States of America (USA), differing laws exist across each of the 50 states regarding the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô. For instance, the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô law in Minnesota makes it a legal obligation for the passers-by to help a person in an emergency, failure of which would fetch a penalty. Meanwhile, the law in Delaware safeguards the ‚ÄòGood Samaritans‚Äô. Furthermore, unlike in India where the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô policy is restricted to saving persons in road accidents, the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô laws in certain states of the USA are applicable to all emergency situations. In fact, there are ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô laws exclusively for helping persons with Drug Overdose and even Environmental Good Samaritans laws. In many western countries, the moral duty to stop and render treatment to an injured or ill person has been recognized instead of making it a legal requirement.

Awareness & Quick Decision making for Award money is necessary

While the policy to encourage the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô with a cash award is a step in the right direction, this would be successful only when there is widespread awareness about both the award and the procedure involved. Further, the procedure & timelines to extend cash award to the ‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô should be followed scrupulously without any delay. Unless these happen, the scheme would not be successful.

541,Five killed in accidents during Puja days in Tripura,"Five people were killed and 13 sustained injuries in separate accidents amid Puja festivities in Tripura, including one person who got crushed beneath a Durga idol during immersion at Lefunga in West Tripura, the police said. Besides, a case of gang rape was registered in Dhalai district‚Äôs Salema.

Speaking to indianexpress.com, Inspector General (law and order) Arindam Nath said a road accident left two dead in 43 Mile area of Mungiyakami in Khowai district, 40 km from Agartala, on Tuesday when a car travelling from Ambassa in Dhalai district towards Teliamura in Khowai allegedly lost control near a curve and fell into a deep gorge.

‚ÄúFive persons were reported to have died in four accidents. Among these, one person fell beneath a Durga Puja idol at Lefunga. Two others died when a vehicle rolled down a gorge. Two others were killed in road accidents,‚Äù the official said.

According to officials at the police headquarters, 13 persons sustained injuries in road accidents at Champahower in Khowai district. This includes two traffic police personnel, one of whom was hit by a speeding vehicle which tried to flee after violating traffic rules at Teliamura. Three others were injured after a brick-laden truck fell into a ditch at Jogirampara area of Madhupur in West Tripura.

Meanwhile, three persons were arrested in the wake of the gang-rape case registered on Thursday at Salema police station, the IG informed. Further investigation in the case is underway, he said.

The official added that as many as 7,660 police personnel were deployed across the state to maintain law and order and oversee traffic movement during Durga Puja days this year. Besides, eight platoons of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were deployed in areas under eight major police stations to strengthen security measures and ensure that the festive season was peaceful.

As per reports, Durga Puja was celebrated in 2,176 pandals and other locations across Tripura, including 865 pujas organised in urban areas and 1,311 in rural areas. Sensitive places were kept under CCTV surveillance.

Power cuts were reported in different parts of the state ‚Äì especially at Udaipur in Gomati district ‚Äì leaving residents in discomfort. Sources in the Met Department attributed the increased sensation of heat to high levels of humidity. Meanwhile, there were also reports of disruption in drinking water supply.

Appealing for religious cooperation and brotherhood, Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb met leaders of all religious communities on Bijoya Dashami and exchanged pleasantries.","Five people were killed and 13 sustained injuries in separate accidents amid Puja festivities in Tripura, including one person who got crushed beneath a Durga idol during immersion at Lefunga in West Tripura, the police said.

542,Assam Records Over 500 Road Accidents In The Midst Of Durga Puja Festivities - Sentinelassam,"Guwahati: This year, the Assam Government has imposed strict protocols and guidelines during the Durga Puja celebrations as a measure against the spread of coronavirus. Meanwhile, over 500 road accidents were recorded in Assam during the festivities season.

In a report issued by the state emergency services, a total of 541 road accidents were reported in Assam.

A total of 49 road accidents were reported in Kamrup Rural while 48 road accidents were reported in the Golaghat district. The districts of Sonitpur and Tinsukia both reported a total of 32 accidents.

In the last 5 days of the festivities season, 8 road accidents were reported in Kamrup metro.

On October 14, the day of Navami, 137 road accidents were reported making it the highest number compared to other days.

In a report issued by the emergency services, the data gives an idea about the number of accidents that took place between October 11 and 15.

Upon being asked if there was a rise in accident cases this Puja season, he answered, ""Last year there were no Durga Puja celebrations so there were no major accidents as such. In normal days, we cater to about 70 to 80 accidents per day but these days it has gone up to hundred on some days.""

545,Towards safer roads,"Photo by Akshay Nanavati on Unsplash

India witnesses the most road crash-related fatalities in the world. Around 29 children die every day in road accidents and about 1.5 lakh road crash-related deaths occur every year. Rash driving, bad road infrastructure and weak traffic law enforcement have been the major factors contributing to road accidents. Moreover, Indian automobiles lack the Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS) that minimise human errors in driving and reduce road accidents. With features like automatic braking, collision warning and lane-keeping assistance, ADAS is a common feature found in automobiles in developed countries.

In a recent study, Dr Anna Charly and Prof Tom Mathew from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) have analysed the factors that lead to road crashes, which will help develop ADAS suited to the Indian driving conditions. The study was published in the journal Transportation Letters and partially funded by the Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Bombay.

The well-tested ADAS from western countries cannot be directly brought into the Indian markets. These systems are designed according to the driving behaviour, road signs and road infrastructure of a particular place.

‚ÄúThe driving behaviour in India is very different from western countries. Most crashes here occur because of abrupt lane manoeuvring and overtaking, whereas driving discipline is mostly maintained abroad. So risky driving in India has to be identified differently,‚Äù explains Dr Charly, an expert on road safety.

Unlike in previous studies, the researchers analysed a broad range of factors affecting road safety like driving behaviour, the curvature of the road, the presence of steep slopes and time of the day. They chose the 94-kilometre-long Mumbai-Pune expressway, which includes a variety of road terrains and has a long history of frequent road crashes, for their study. They recorded real-time data, such as position, speed and acceleration, of 23 car drivers travelling on the expressway to study the typical driving behaviour. Then, they painstakingly studied the average driving behaviour on 188 segments ‚Äî each one kilometre in length ‚Äî of the expressway, and used it to explain previous road crash data on different road terrains.

The team noticed some patterns in their observations. Most of the previous road crashes had occurred on road segments which were either curved and flat or had a downward slope. On such segments, drivers very often changed lanes and speeds. They also observed many crashes on roads that steeped downward, irrespective of how the drivers drove. To identify the most important road safety factors to predict crashes, they calculated the ‚Äòcorrelation‚Äô between each factor and previous road crash data ‚Äî that is, how likely was it that some factor often led to road crashes?

The researchers concluded that frequent change in driving speeds was unsafe, especially during the night. And abrupt changing of lanes was dangerous, especially during the day. Steep downward roads were also more accident-prone. They used these factors to model possible future road crash scenarios, which they verified using previous crash data. ‚ÄúTraditional road safety analysis is ‚Äòreactive‚Äô and uses road crash data which is often improperly reported without crucial details. So instead, we used a ‚Äòproactive‚Äô approach to identify ‚Äòsurrogate‚Äô events (warning signs of a possible crash) from traffic and driving behaviour data,‚Äù says Prof Mathew. ‚ÄúOur approach eliminates the need for less reliable road crash data, and can be used for new traffic facilities where such data isn't available.‚Äù Their model can be used to set thresholds for risky driving behaviour and help the ADAS take automatic counter measures.

Though the study was conducted on an expressway, the results can be extended to the city roads.

‚ÄúOur conclusions on the important factors, and how they could be risky, apply to all types of roads because the driving behaviour is the same. Only the thresholds would be different,‚Äù says Dr Charly. ‚ÄúFor example, on expressways vehicles are allowed to travel at very high speeds, unlike within a city. So driving performance thresholds are set taking that into consideration,‚Äù she adds.

The researchers are currently improving their prediction model. ‚ÄúWe mainly studied passenger cars, but driving behaviour depends on the type of vehicle. A behaviour which is significant among car drivers might not be so for two-wheeler or truck drivers. We also want to study environmental parameters like rain and visibility,‚Äù says Dr Charly. Interestingly, the UN had declared 2010‚Äì20 as the decade of action for road safety. With efforts on the research front as well, let us hope for safer roads in future.

546,India accounts for 11 per cent of global death in road accidents: World Bank,"With only 1 per cent of the world's vehicles, India accounts for 11 per cent of the global death in road accidents, the highest in the world, according to a report by the World Bank.

The country accounts for about 4.5 lakh road crashes per annum, in which 1.5 lakh people die.

""India tops the world in road crash deaths and injuries. It has 1 per cent of the world's vehicles but accounts for 11 per cent of all road crash deaths, witnessing 53 road crashes every hour; killing 1 person every 4 minutes,"" the report said.

In the last decade, 13 lakh people died and another 50 lakh got injured on Indian roads, it said.

""Considering the under reporting phenomenon and using the crash ratios for the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways crash numbers"", the report estimates the crash costs at Rs 5.96 lakh crore or 3.14 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).

The 2019 World Bank report, titled 'Guide for Road Safety Opportunities and Challenges: Low- and Middle-Income Countries Country Profiles', puts the road crash and serious injury cost estimate at 7.5 per cent of India's GDP or Rs 12.9 lakh crore for 2016. It is more than twice the figure cited by the government at 3 per cent of GDP or Rs 4.3 lakh crore, it added.

A recent study commissioned by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) estimates the socio-economic costs of road crashes at Rs 1,47,114 crore in India, which is equivalent to 0.77 per cent of the country's GDP.

""Considering the under reporting phenomenon and using the crash ratios for MoRTH crash numbers, the same study estimates the crash costs at Rs 5.96 lakh crores i.e. equivalent to 3.14 per cent,"" it said.

At the individual level, road crash injuries and deaths impose a severe financial burden and push entire (non-poor) households into poverty and the already poor into debt.

As per the Ministry, 76.2 per cent of people who are killed in road crashes are in their prime working-age, 18-45 years.

Globally, road traffic injuries (RTIs) are the eighth leading cause of death.

‚ÄòPoor, male road-users of working age, constitute VRU category‚Äô

According to the World Bank, the road crash fatality rate is three times higher in low-income countries compared to high-income countries, and statistics from India further reinforce this global trend.

There is a distinct correlation between socio-economic status and road use patterns in low- and middle-income countries like India and ""poor people are more likely to be involved in a road traffic crash"", it said.

In a country like India, where vulnerable road users are forced to share space with other less vulnerable road users, the income level of an individual has a direct bearing on the mode of transport used.

This in turn further determines the level of risk faced by a particular road user. The report said daily wage workers and workers employed as casual labourers in informal activities are more prone to be defined as vulnerable compared to workers engaged in regular activities.

""It is no coincidence, then, that it is often the poor, especially male road-users of working age, that constitute the category of vulnerable road users (VRUs) in India.

""VRUs bear a disproportionately large burden of road crashes and account for more than half of all road crash deaths and serious injuries in the country,"" it said.

As the world navigates through the Covid-19 pandemic, the road crash pandemic continues to fester the socio-economic landscape in India, the report said.

On Saturday, Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Nitin Gakdari has termed road accident scenario in India more ""dangerous than the Covid-19 pandemic"". He has said there could be a saving of Rs 90 lakh per person by preventing deaths and reducing injuries to minor ones in such incidents.

The Minister had stressed that the accident cost is a tremendous burden to society and the nation, and the estimated cost of a death in a road accident is around Rs 91.16 lakh.

Releasing the World Bank report on 'Traffic Crash Injuries And Disabilities: The Burden on India Society', Gadkari had said that in this alarming scenario, his ministry will formulate policies to protect the interest of the poor and embark on several reformative steps.","With only 1 per cent of the world's vehicles, India accounts for 11 per cent of the global death in road accidents, the highest in the world, according to a report by the World Bank.
The country accounts for about 4.5 lakh road crashes per annum, in which 1.5 lakh people die.
""India tops the world in road crash deaths and injuries.
It has 1 per cent of the world's vehicles but accounts for 11 per cent of all road crash deaths, witnessing 53 road crashes every hour; killing 1 person every 4 minutes,"" the report said.

552,"India witnessed 4.49 lakh road accidents, 1.51 lakh deaths in 2019","By PTI

NEW DELHI: A total of 4,49,002 road accidents occurred in India in 2019, causing 1,51,113 deaths, despite the number of such road mishaps coming down during the year when compared with 2018, Parliament was informed on Monday.

In a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said that road accidents are occurring due to multiple causes such as over speeding, drunken driving, consumption of alcohol, driving on wrong side/lane, indiscipline, fault of the driver of motor vehicle, use of mobile phones during driving etc.

The number of road accidents in 2018 was 4,67,044 and deaths were recorded at 1,51,417.

Gadkari said his ministry has implemented a scheme for undertaking publicity measures and awareness campaigns on road safety to create awareness among road users through the electronic media, print media, NGOs etc.

He added that high priority has been taken to identify and rectify black spots (accident prone spots) on national highways.

Gadkari noted that safety standards for automobiles have been improved and the ministry has notified fitment of speed limiting devices on all transport vehicles.

Replying to a separate question, he said the government does not collect data on removal of liquor shops situated along the national highways as this is a state subject.

The Supreme Court of India has issued directions regarding stopping the grant of licences for sale of liquor along national and state highways and over a distance of 500 metres from the outer edge of the national or state highways or of a service lane along the highway.

""As per the orders of Hon'ble Supreme Court, the ministry has requested all the state governments and UTs, from time to time, to take necessary action for implementation of the order(s) of Hon'ble Supreme Court.

""Further, Section 185 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 provides for punishment of imprisonment or fine or both for the offence of drunken driving cases,"" he said.

Stating that the ministry deals with the matters related to development of national highways and providing access to properties situated along the national highways, he said the ministry has no control on the usage of and business run in these properties located beyond the Right of Way (ROW) of national highways.

553,Road safety:IIT researchers working on first-of-its kind geography based smart speed warning system By Gu,"



New Delhi: Researchers at different Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are working on development of a first-of-its kind ""smart speed warning system"" for vehicles which will alert the driver on the basis of road infrastructure and geographical location to avoid over-speeding related crashes.

According to statistics available with the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, about 70 per cent of road fatalities in India occur due to over-speeding.

To minimise such fatalities, the government had mandated that all new cars sold from July 1, 2019, should include a speed governor device that will generate intermittent warning beeps for above 80 kmph and the constant beep for above 120 kmph for drivers. To further reduce damage to lives, the fine for speeding was increased by ten times under the new Motor Vehicles Act of 2019.

However, the researchers at IIT Guwahati and Bombay believe the current speed governing device is a ""one size fits all"" solution and does not have much intelligence and the same system cannot effectively work while driving in hilly terrains, plains or desert areas.

""Our studies revealed the safe speed for a vehicle can significantly vary with changes in road geometry like on sharp or blind curves or hairpin bends. Therefore, there is a need to develop a smart speed warning system incorporating a dynamic and adaptable speed threshold based on upcoming road infrastructure to avoid overspeeding-related crashes,"" Akhilesh Kumar Maurya, Civil Engineering Professor at IIT Guwahati, told PTI.

""Traditional warning systems are based on the fixed speed threshold, however, the concept of a smart warning system is based on upcoming road infrastructure and vehicle location. On approaching curves along a roadway, including blind curves or hairpin bends, vehicles equipped with such a system will warn drivers in advance, which will allow drivers to adopt corrective actions and avoid accidents,"" he added.

The researchers, who are in process of filing a patent for the system, claim that such a system is not available anywhere across the globe.

According to the team, algorithm for the smart speed warning system was developed based on the field data collected from a 45 km stretch of four-lane highway (NH-40) between Jorabat in Assam and Nongpoh in Meghalaya, consisting of 285 horizontal curves. The study section covered a broader range of road geometry (curve radius ranges from 20-800m, curve length varies from 30-244 m and gradient varied from seven per cent to nine per cent.

""We are in the process of analysing data of two-lane undivided highway NH-61 between Mumbai and Malshej Ghat in Maharashtra. We have now completed our pilot studies along four-lane divided highway, NH-160 between Thane and Nashik (Maharashtra) and now planning to collect detailed data very soon,"" Maurya said.

The team plans to conduct similar pilot studies at different highways across the country to get an idea of different geographical locations and present the model ultimately to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).

During the pilot studies of speed prediction model development, the researchers came up with car speed model and HCV and LCV speed model.

According to Avijit Maji, Associate Professor at IIT Bombay's Civil Engineering department, researchers have used operating speed of vehicles as one of the surrogate measures for safety evaluation of horizontal curves

""Now, the 85th percentile speed of vehicles in free-flow condition is widely considered as the operating speed. However, the geometric features of highways are designed on the basis of design speed. Some studies pointed out that the design speed might be represented by 95th to 98th percentile speed of vehicles in free-flow condition,"" he described in a paper published in the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) journal.

""Drivers in developing nations are not well disciplined and often drive solely based on their perception of the road geometry. Hence, the 98th percentile vehicle speed can be useful in evaluating safety of a highway section in such country. Now, the available vehicle speed prediction models vary widely. Differences in driver behaviour and highway geometry might be the reasons for these variations,"" he added.

Another research scholar from the team asserted that studies show that the decision-making process and driver performance greatly depends on situational awareness.

""Drivers intend to operate vehicles at safe speed based on the roadway geometric features. These features are characterised by gradient, horizontal curvature, length of curves and tangent sections, superelevation, etc. Perceptive and consistent geometric characteristics of the roadway can ease the decision making burden and thus minimise driver error.

""So far, majority of the studies on geometric design consistency are conducted on isolated curve sections in plain terrain for traffic with strong lane discipline. The effect of gradient is not significant in these terrains. Further, the driving behaviour of traffic with weak lane discipline is not represented in these studies,"" he described.","New Delhi: Researchers at different Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are working on development of a first-of-its kind ""smart speed warning system"" for vehicles which will alert the driver on the basis of road infrastructure and geographical location to avoid over-speeding related crashes.

The works relating to ‚ÄòBlack Spots‚Äô should be completed expeditiously, and quality check should be carried out after completion of work to assess if number of accidents at these spots came down, he added. Justice Sapre emphasised upon the need for making the people aware of various aspects of road safety by way of effective co-ordination among agencies concerned. The persons injured in road mishaps must get medical treatment immediately, and other related actions should be taken expeditiously. Government may construct good roads, have speed-breakers, traffic sign-boards at appropriate locations. However, he observed, ‚ÄúIt is for the people to wear helmet, use seat-belt, not go wrong side, not ride/drive in an inebriated condition, and follow self-discipline as well as traffic rules.‚Äù He appealed to the agencies concerned to implement awareness drives regularly.","‚Äò69% of road mishaps due to violation of speed limit‚ÄôJustice (retd) Abhay Sapre interacting with officers including Dr Bhushankumar Upadhyay, Additional DG (Highways); Aswathi Dorje, Joint Commissioner of Police, and others, during a meeting held here on Sunday.

557,12 dead in India after bus swerves to avoid stray cattle,"Twelve people were killed in northern India on Thursday after the bus they were on swerved off the road and hit a truck, police said.

The bus driver veered off track to avoid hitting stray cattle on the road, authorities said.

The accident occurred in Barabanki district, 40 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of Lucknow city. Another 32 were injured out of the total 60 passengers onboard.

There are fears the number of dead could increase as several passengers received critical injuries, Senior Police Officer Yamuna Prasad said. They were being treated in a hospital.

More than 110,000 people are killed every year in road accidents across India, according to police. Most crashes are blamed on reckless driving, poorly maintained roads and aging vehicles.","Twelve people were killed in northern India on Thursday after the bus they were on swerved off the road and hit a truck, police said.

558,Nearly 30 pc of children have witnessed road crash on way to school: Survey,"Outlook October 07, 2021 16:45 IST Nearly 30 pc of children have witnessed road crash on way to school: Survey outlookindia.com 1970-01-01T05:30:00+0530

New Delhi, Oct 7 (PTI) Nearly 30 per cent of children have witnessed a road crash during their travel to school, while 6 per cent of them were involved in such accidents, a survey showed.

The survey was conducted by SaveLIFE Foundation in collaboration with Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India (MBRDI) with the intent of gathering insights across age-groups and geographies to inform how to improve the road safety of children while they commute to school.

The survey, conducted after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, analyses responses from 11,845 respondents, including 5,711 children (of classes 6-12) and 6,134 parents (with children in classes 1-12) across 14 cities in India.

It also showed that more than half of the parents surveyed stated that school authorities took no action on the safety concerns reported to them.

These issues included overcrowding in school vehicles, congestion near the school, and over-speeding by drivers in the school zone, it said.

""Overall, school bus was reported by the highest proportion of respondents as the mode of commute (33 per cent of children), followed by school van (12 per cent),"" the survey said.

The cities surveyed include Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Chennai, Delhi, Jaipur, Jamshedpur, Kanpur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Patna, Pune, and Vijayawada

Nearly 47 per cent of the respondents reported that their vehicles did not have seat belts. Bengaluru (78 per cent ) and Lucknow (66 per cent) had higher proportion of school vehicles equipped with seat belts.

Only 13 per cent of the respondents in Vijayawada, and 28 per cent of the respondents in Kolkata reported that their vehicles were equipped with seat belts, it said.

The survey also highlighted gaps in the safety standards of school zones. Nearly 47 per cent of the surveyed respondents whose child/who cycled to school reported no cycling paths en route or even around the school.

Around 30 per cent of those whose child/who walked to school reported missing footpaths around the school zone.

The survey highlighted that adherence to guidelines among private transport users is lower than school-provided transport.

India is home to over 500 million children under the age of 18 years. Road crashes are the leading cause of deaths and unintentional injuries amongst children, making them one of the most high-risk vulnerable sections of the population on Indian roads. PTI BKS

559,Road deaths in 2020 was the lowest in 11 years,"NEW DELHI: Road accidents claimed around 1.32 lakh lives in 2020, which is the lowest in the past 11 years. The earlier lowest was 1.26 lakh in 2009.The number of road accidents also fell to 3.66 lakh during last year, which was lowest in the past 20 years. The sharp decline in road deaths and crashes was primarily because of restriction on movement of vehicles during to Covid-induced lockdown across the country. In 2019, around 1.51 lakh lives were lost in road crashes in India.Replying to a question in the Lok Sabha, transport minister Nitin Gadkari quoted the reduction in deaths and said his ministry has formulated a multi-pronged strategy to address the issue of road safety based on education, engineering (of roads and vehicles), enforcement and emergency care.The road fatalities had witnessed sharpest decline in the April-June quarter of 2020 calendar year when 20,732 persons were killed compared to 41,032 during the same period in 2019. Most parts of the country were under lockdown during this period. ‚ÄúThis simply shows why we must not treat road crashes as a fate.

561,IIT Madras Researchers developing Data-Driven Strategies to enhance Road Safety in Tamil Nadu,"CHENNAI : Indian Institute of Technology Madras Researchers are developing data-driven strategies to enhance road Safety in Tamil Nadu. Towards this, a one-day workshop on developing an action plan was organized today (12) by Center of Excellence for Human Factors and Safety Science @ RBG Labs, IIT Madras, in coordination with the National Health Mission.

Various stakeholders involved in road safety include the Police, Health, Transport, Road owning agencies, Education, Rural Development, and Local Self Government, among others, participated in the workshop held at IIT Madras Research Park.

The outcomes of this workshop will be used to help a focused action plan and be used as a policy advisory to help reduce road accidents and fatalities in Tamil Nadu.

Conveying his message for the workshop, Thiru Ma. Subramanian, Minister for Health, Medical Education and Family Welfare, Government of Tamil Nadu, said, ‚ÄúThis workshop is the first of many such design-thinking based strategizing workshops for road safety. This coordinated knowledge sharing session among all the road safety stakeholders in Tamil Nadu will be a pathway to continuously evolve successful road safety policies in the State.‚Äù

The key outcomes envisaged from this program include:

√ò Clear long term policies and strategies for moving towards an ‚Äòaccident-free Tamil Nadu‚Äô

√ò Short term strategies to improve road safety and minimize road traffic accidents during the next 3 months (November 2021 to January 2022)

√ò Action Points and Key Performance Indicators for each of the Stakeholder Departments, including Health, Police, Road owning agencies, Transport, Education and Local Bodies.

√ò Modalities for sharing and utilizing the data available with Stakeholder departments for collective action in ensuring road safety. For example, Grid Analysis data available with Health Departments shall be used for enforcement, preventive action awareness creation, among others, by the stakeholder departments concerned.

Elaborating on this engagement, Prof. Venkatesh Balasubramanian, Faculty In-Charge, Center of Excellence for Human Factors and Safety Science @ RBG Labs, IIT Madras, who is coordinating this workshop, said, ‚ÄúAvoiding accidents and fatalities in accidents is an essential requirement to be a developed nation. Roads are shared assets and the safety on them is a collective responsibility of all the stakeholders.‚Äù

Further, Prof. Venkatesh Balasubramanian said, ‚ÄúWe have been advocating a data-driven systems approach to road safety through our Transportation Safety Framework (TSF) to have a holistic improvement. While TN has been performing well on reducing the fatalities from road accidents, in 2021, after the lockdown there has been a steady increase in fatality. Therefore, it is quintessential to develop a good strategy based on data to address this on a priority basis. It is, therefore, necessary to have a design thinking approach to solve the problem by not just identifying the issues but implementing changes that are sustainable in the local conditions.‚Äù

In 2020, Tamil Nadu became the first State in India and globally, the only administered territory to have achieved a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target of reducing deaths due to road accidents by 50 per cent. However, there has been a steady increase in the number of road fatalities in 2021.

Speaking on the occasion, Prof. Ravindra Gettu, Dean (Industrial Consultancy and Sponsored Research), IIT Madras, said, ‚ÄúThe Action plan that has been drawn up is expected to make a significant impact on fatalities and road safety in general, especially due to the involvement of all stakeholders concerned through this design thinking approach.‚Äù

To curb the seasonal peak traffic crashes in the fourth quarter of 2021, a strategic team of TN stakeholders involved in road safety were identified to prepare a strategic short-term and long-term action plan for improving road safety in the State.

Fret not; this rule is only applicable for those who are travelling on a two-wheeled vehicle in Kerala.

As bizarre as this rule sounds, it will keep all the passengers and nearby pedestrians safe during the rainy season. People travelling via a bike are often seen using an open umbrella while they are moving through traffic, which can be very unsafe.

As Kerala receives a lot of rainfall, many people travelling on bikes and scooters were seen using umbrellas while driving. This lead to a dramatic rise in road accidents during the rains in Kerala, thus, this new rule has been imposed.

Keeping all these accidents in mind, the Transport Commissioner of Kerala has written a letter to all the traffic authorities to restrict travellers on two-wheelers from using umbrellas while driving their vehicles. The authorities have stated that using an umbrella while winds are moving at high speed is very dangerous, and can lead the person to get misbalanced and falling off.

Last month, a 52-year-old woman in Kerala fell off a motorcycle and injured herself while trying to open an umbrella on the moving vehicle. The woman, who was travelling with her son, suffered serious head injuries due to this incident, and later succumbed to them.

In view of these accidents, the traffic police in Kerala will keep a close watch on all those travelling by two-wheelers and challan will be issued if they don‚Äôt follow the newly implemented rule.","Fret not; this rule is only applicable for those who are travelling on a two-wheeled vehicle in Kerala.

564,"With 53 road crashes per hour, road accidents in India continue to be highest in world","With 53 road crashes per hour, road accidents in India continue to be highest in world

We have known for quite some time now that the state of road safety in India is abysmal, to say the least. Come to think of it, the horrifying state of things in the context of road safety in India has been for the world to see. And now we have yet another reminder of just how deadly roads are -- this time from the World Bank. Yep, the World Bank recently released a new report that makes some interesting notes about India. For starters, the report noted that even though India is home to just 1 per cent of the world's vehicles, we still account for 11 per cent of the global road accident deaths. This is the highest in the world, by the way. It offers an even more grim number: 53 road accidents occur in India every our, killing one person every 4 minutes.

The World Bank's 2019 report, Guide for Road Safety Opportunities and Challenges: Low- and Middle-Income Countries Country Profiles, added that 13 lakh people died and another 50 lakh people have sustained injuries on Indian roads just in the last decade. Wait, there's more -- the report, factoring in the under reporting phenomenon and the crash ratios for the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways crash numbers, estimates the crashes cost the country a staggering a sum.

Road accidents in India: The cost we pay

What's even more interesting to note is that this report says the road crash and serious injury cost estimate for 2016 stood at 7.5 per cent of India's GDP or ‚Çπ12.9 lakh crore. This is more than two-folds the figure cited by the Indian government -- i.e. 3 per cent of GDP or ‚Çπ4.3 lakh crore. Speaking in the context of individuals, road accident injuries and deaths result in crippling financial burden and push non-poor households into poverty and the already poor into debt.

Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways, recently described India's road accident situation as more ""dangerous than the COVID-19 pandemic"". He added that the prevention of deaths and a reduction in injuries during road accidents can have far-reaching financial benefits as well. Gadkari said the estimated cost of a death in a road accident is about ‚Çπ91.16 lakh.","With 53 road crashes per hour, road accidents in India continue to be highest in worldWe have known for quite some time now that the state of road safety in India is abysmal, to say the least.

565,IIT researchers working on smart speed warning system based on geography,"Researchers at different Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are developing a first-of-its kind smart speed warning system for vehicles which can be used alert a driver based on road infrastructure as well as geographical location. This system is aimed to help avoid over-speeding related accidents in the country.

About 70 per cent of road fatalities in the country occur due to over-speeding, as per information from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.

Similar Bikes

In order to reduce such fatalities, the government had made it compulsory for all new cars sold from July 1 of 2019 to be equipped with a speed monitor device that will provide intermittent warning beeps for vehicles when they reach above 80 kmph and a constant beep for above 120 kmph. Further, the fine for speeding vehicles was increased by ten times under the new Motor Vehicles Act of 2019.

(Also read | Artificial intelligence can help reduce road deaths by half by 2030, says UN)

However, as per researchers from IIT Guwahati and Bombay, the current speed governing device is akin to a ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô solution. It does not offer much intelligence and thus, cannot effectively work while driving in hilly terrains, plains or desert areas. ‚ÄúOur studies revealed the safe speed for a vehicle can significantly vary with changes in road geometry like on sharp or blind curves or hairpin bends,"" Akhilesh Kumar Maurya, Civil Engineering Professor at IIT Guwahati, told PTI.

Thus, there is a need to develop a smart speed warning system that incorporates dynamic and adaptable speed threshold on the basis of upcoming road infrastructure and geography. ""Traditional warning systems are based on the fixed speed threshold, however, the concept of a smart warning system is based on upcoming road infrastructure and vehicle location,"" he clarified.

(Also read | Nearly 30% of children have witnessed road crash on way to school: Survey)

The IIT researchers are in the process of filing a patent for the smart speed warning system as they claim that such a system is not available anywhere around the world. The team of researchers also plan to conduct pilot studies at different highways across the country so as to find out the different geographical locations and present the model ultimately to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).

A day earlier, on Monday, at least four others had lost their lives on the same route and several others have met with fatal accidents in the state in the month of June alone.As per the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) report of 2019, Uttar Pradesh (UP) made up for the largest share - 15% of total road accident deaths in the country. In 2019, the state had witnessed 22,655 deaths due to road accidents, which was the highest across India.MoRTH has not yet released its national report for 2020 and 2021.With 19,731 fatal road accidents, UP has the infamous reputation of the highest number of fatal road accidents in the country too, as per MoRTH.As per the MoRTH report, the maximum number of road accidents and deaths in UP are due to over-speeding. In the year 2019, there were 15,934 over speeding incidents causing death of 8,398 people.The second highest number of accidents in 2019, took place due to driving on the wrong side - 4988 accidents, which caused 2517 deaths. UP contributed the maximum number of over speeding deaths in the country that year.Another common reason for road accidents in UP is the use of mobile phones which caused 4,882 accidents and death of 2,969 people. This is also the maximum data in this category as against any other state in the country.Other causes of road accidents include drunken driving/consumption - 4496 accidents and 2,224 deaths, and jumping red lights which caused 874 accidents and 297 deaths.Working with the state government for reducing accidents on the Yamuna Expressway , founder and CEO of SaveLife Foundation SLF ), Piyush Tewari told TOI, ""In 2019, UP suffered 22,655 road crash deaths and close to 29,000 injuries in road crashes. The high numbers are attributable to the deadly mix of poor road-user behaviour and road infrastructure issues. For instance, in 2019, over 1000 people died in the state due to potholes alone. Similarly, conflict between fast-moving traffic and slower, more vulnerable road-users, such as pedestrians leads to a large number of fatalities and injuries.""""Close to 40% overspeeding incidents also happen because of improper parking"", he added.Taking cognizance of this issue, the state government along with SLF has identified high-fatality roads, such as Yamuna Expressway and NH 2 for interventions under project 'Vision Zero‚Äô""Forensic investigation of crashes has been introduced to identify human causes of crashes but also those related to road infrastructure and vehicles. The identified issues are addressed expeditiously, such as the installation of a median crash barrier on the Yamuna Expressway,"" Tewari said.","In 2019, the state had witnessed 22,655 deaths due to road accidents, which was the highest across India.MoRTH has not yet released its national report for 2020 and 2021.With 19,731 fatal road accidents, UP has the infamous reputation of the highest number of fatal road accidents in the country too, as per MoRTH.As per the MoRTH report, the maximum number of road accidents and deaths in UP are due to over-speeding.
UP contributed the maximum number of over speeding deaths in the country that year.Another common reason for road accidents in UP is the use of mobile phones which caused 4,882 accidents and death of 2,969 people.

568,Data-driven Strategies to enhance road safety in TN,"Chennai: Researchers of Indian Institute of Technology Madras are developing data-driven strategies to enhance road Safety in Tamilnadu. Towards this, a one-day workshop on developing an action plan was organised recently by Center of Excellence for Human Factors and Safety Science at RBG Labs, IIT Madras, in coordination with the National Health Mission.

Various stakeholders involved in road safety include the Police, Health, Transport, Road owning agencies, Education, Rural Development, and Local Self Government, among others, participated in the workshop held at IIT Madras Research Park.

The outcomes of this workshop will be used to help a focused action plan and be used as a policy advisory to help reduce road accidents and fatalities in Tamilnadu.

Conveying his message for the workshop, Health Minister Ma Subramanian, said, ‚ÄòThis workshop is the first of many such design-thinking based strategizing workshops for road safety. This coordinated knowledge sharing session among all the road safety stakeholders in Tamilnadu will be a pathway to continuously evolve successful road safety policies in the State.‚Äô

The key outcomes envisaged from this program include: Clear long term policies and strategies for moving towards an ‚Äòaccident-free Tamilnadu‚Äô, Short term strategies to improve road safety and minimise road traffic accidents during the next three months, Action Points and Key Performance Indicators for each of the Stakeholder Departments, including Health, Police,

Road owning agencies, Transport, Education and Local Bodies, Modalities for sharing and utilizing the data available with Stakeholder departments for collective action in ensuring road safety.

For example, Grid Analysis data available with Health Departments shall be used for enforcement, preventive action awareness creation, among others, by the stakeholder departments concerned.

Elaborating on this engagement, Prof. Venkatesh Balasubramanian, Faculty In-Charge, Center of Excellence for Human Factors and Safety Science at RBG Labs, IIT Madras, who coordinated the workshop, said, ‚ÄòAvoiding accidents and fatalities in accidents is an essential requirement to be a developed nation. Roads are shared assets and the safety on them is a collective responsibility of all the stakeholders.‚Äô

Further, Prof. Venkatesh Balasubramanian said, ‚ÄòWe have been advocating a data-driven systems approach to road safety through our Transportation Safety Framework (TSF) to have a holistic improvement. While TN has been performing well on reducing the fatalities from road accidents, in 2021, after the lockdown there has been a steady increase in fatality. Therefore, it is

quintessential to develop a good strategy based on data to address this on a priority basis. It is, therefore, necessary to have a design thinking approach to solve the problem by not just identifying the issues but implementing changes that are sustainable in the local conditions.‚Äô

In 2020, Tamilnadu became the first State in India and globally, the only administered territory to have achieved a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target of reducing deaths due to road accidents by 50 per cent. However, there has been a steady increase in the number of road fatalities in 2021.

National campaign for women drivers

A nationwide campaign has been launched to encourage women to pick up driving skills and remove roadblocks within the ecosystem to increase their job prospects in transportation businesses including as taxi and e-rickshaw drivers or as delivery agents for e-commerce companies.

The campaign titled ‚ÄòMoving Boundaries‚Äô is a joint initiative of Shell Foundation, a UK based charity and the United Kingdom government in association with Moving Women Social Initiatives Foundation (MOWO).

Jai Bharathi, founder of MOWO is touring India on her motorbike from for a period of over 40 days and covering over 20 cities to create awareness and encourage women to learn driving to increase their job opportunities. Bharathi reached Chennai recently on the current leg of her tour.","Chennai: Researchers of Indian Institute of Technology Madras are developing data-driven strategies to enhance road Safety in Tamilnadu.

570,"Experts point at flaws, NHAI says measures in place","Gurgaon: All ‚Äúspeed calming measures‚Äù and norms laid down by the Indian Road Congress (IRC) are in place on the U-turn flyover at IFFCO Chowk, the National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) officials said, even as road safety experts alleged that flyovers across NCR were planned keeping cars and not two-wheelers in mind. The safety of these structures have come under the spotlight on Sunday after two bikers died allegedly after they lost balance and toppled over the railing of the flyover 20 feet below.‚ÄúThis kind of incident has not happened (on the flyover) before and most likely occurred due to over speeding on the part of the commuter. From our end, all safety measures have been taken from the very first day. All speed calming measures are in place. We have also put signage alerting people to the speed limit of 40 kilometres per hour and have installed four rows of cat's eye where the curvature of the flyover begins so that the speed of a vehicle gets reduced automatically,‚Äù an NHAI official, who did not want to be identified, told TOI.Speed breakers, as per the NHAI, cannot be put on these elevated roads because there was a chance of vehicles jumping on these as well. Used by commuters travelling from MG Road and Huda City Centre towards Delhi and Sukhrali, the four-lane unidirectional flyover was constructed and opened to commuters in 2018.‚ÄúChevron boards that warn drivers of the curve ahead, and other relevant signage have been also installed at the curvature. The height of the boundary wall is also as per the IRC standards. Multiple safety audits of the structure have not shown any discrepancies,‚Äù the official added.Road safety experts with whom TOI spoke, however, said that such accidents were increasing not just in Gurgaon but across the NCR and the rest of the country. Multiple factors, they say, are responsible for this.‚ÄúOne of the issues is that these structures are normally designed for cars without taking two-wheelers into consideration. The U-turns and ramps on the interchanges are, however, also used by two-wheelers, which tend to then move at the same speed as a car but may not be necessarily safe for them. In addition, side crash protections are not taken into consideration, as a result of which commuters topple over because sufficient protection has not been given on the side of the structure and the sidewall has not been correctly designed,‚Äù Sewa Ram, associate professor and urban roads design expert at the School of Planning and Architecture, said.Ram recommended the usage of ‚Äúlow-height speed-calming measures‚Äù and designing ‚Äúforgiving roads‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhat forgiving roads do is that if there are three lanes, the outer lane, closest to the boundary wall, is painted in such a way as to alert the commuters not to drive on it. So, if by mistake a person‚Äôs vehicle starts skidding, the outer lane serves as a buffer, ensuring they will skid onto the lane but not fall down. The logic of forgiving measures is that if a person does make a mistake, they do not pay with their life,‚Äù Ram said.Rohit Baluja, director of the Institute of Road Traffic Education, meanwhile, attributed such mishaps to the absence of traffic engineering within the traffic management system and emphasised the need to follow the principles of a ‚Äúsafe systems approach‚Äù, which anticipates mistakes of commuters and implies taking measures to ensure that people do not die or sustain serious injuries.","Gurgaon: All ‚Äúspeed calming measures‚Äù and norms laid down by the Indian Road Congress (IRC) are in place on the U-turn flyover at IFFCO Chowk, the National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) officials said, even as road safety experts alleged that flyovers across NCR were planned keeping cars and not two-wheelers in mind.

571,"National highways in south account for most road accidents, black spots; UP, Tamil Nadu top among states","Given the regional disparities in the national highway network in India and the concentration of traffic-related injuries to a few states or regions, a localised approach to road safety may be more suited

In India, every year more people die of road traffic injuries or road accidents than of malaria, tuberculosis or HIV. In 2019 alone, over 1.51 lakh people died due to injuries caused by road accidents. This was more than the total deaths caused by the three diseases combined.

In 2019, malaria killed 7,700 people, the human immunodeficiency virus killed 58,960 while tuberculosis claimed 79,144 lives.

The situation, however, seems to be improving. Between 2018 and 2020 India witnessed a drop in road traffic injuries. While 1,40,843 road accidents were reported in national highways and expressways in 2018, they fell to 1,37,191 in 2019. The number of road accidents reduced further to 1,16,496 in 2020 (provisional data). The reduction in road traffic injuries was witnessed across all the seven major regions - south, north, east, west, north-west, north-east and central India.

NHs and expressways in south report maximum road traffic injuries

However, government data show that road accidents are concentrated in a few problem states such as Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, or regions such as south India.

As per the 2020 provisional data, south India (includes the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Goa, and the UTs of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, and Puducherry) accounted for 41.6 percent or 48,476 of the total 1,16,496 road traffic injuries. The figures were 59,280 in 2018 and 57,457 in 2019.

In contrast, all other regions, north, west, east, central, north-west and north-east reported less than 15,000 road accidents in 2020.

Region States Year 2018 Year 2019 Year 2020 South Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Goa, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Puducherry 59280 57457 48476 North Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand 17014 16843 14219 North West Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi and Rajasthan 18307 17118 13867 Central Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh 13962 14251 13296 East West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand 13910 14285 12884 West Gujarat, Maharashtra, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu 13352 11871 9735 North East Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura 5018 5366 3986 Grand Total 140843 137191 116496 SOURCE: Press Information Bureau, Government of India

Among other regions, in 2002, north (Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand) reported the second-highest (14,219) road accidents in 2020. The north-west region (Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi and Rajasthan), which reported the second-highest road traffic injuries in 2019 at 17,718 reduced the numbers to 13,867 in 2020.

It's to be noted that south India also accounts for the maximum length of national highways at 24,098 kilometres as of 2017.

But then, among states, Tamil Nadu in the south reported 15,269 road accidents, the highest in 2020. The southern state had 4,946 kilometres of national highways as of 2017. Uttar Pradesh, which had 8,712 kilometres of national highways (second highest in 2017), accounted for 13,695 road traffic injuries and Karnataka (6,762 kilometres of NHs in 2017) reported 11,230 road accidents. These three states have contributed the maximum number of road accidents in 2018 as well as 2019.

However, Maharashtra, which accounted for the largest network of national highways at 15,437 kilometres in 2017, reported 9,355, 8,360 and 6,501 in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

What's the solution?

Reducing deaths due to road traffic injuries in India has been a major focus of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) under Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari.

Stating the need for an engineering-driven approach to reduce road traffic injuries in India, the Union minister in June 2021 had said that 50 percent of the road accidents in India are due to road engineering problems. He added that the government has taken special initiatives to identify and improve black spots.

The ministry, according to a report published in June this year, is allocating ‚Çπ14,000 crores for states, the National Highways Authority of India and other stakeholders to remove black spots under a scheme sanctioned by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

On Thursday, PIB issued a statement by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH), stating that it has already identified 5,803 black spots on national highways based on accident and fatality data between 2015 and 2018 in 30 states and UTs.

The ministry said that temporary measures have been taken on 5,167 black spots and 2,923 Black spots have been permanently rectified.

What are black spots?

In transportation, a black spot is not a literal spot on the road, but a short stretch of the road usually of about 500 metres in length, which is prone to accidents.

As per MORTH, a stretch of road is termed a black spot if ""five accidents involving serious injuries/fatalities or ten fatalities took place during the past three calendar years"".

However, ""some times a single accident can have multiple fatalities, hence a number of fatal/grievous accidents at the same location is a better indicator of problematic road/road environment (ie, black spot) than the number of fatalities"".

Why are they crucial?

Identification and rectification of black spots on national highways and state highways (SHs) have been one of the dimensions of India's policies to reduce road traffic crashes. The rectification of black spots is done using short-term remedies such as installing cautionary road signs and markings, transverse bar markings, rumble strips and solar blinkers, etc, as well as long-term remedies such as providing flyover, underpasses, foot-over bridges, service roads, etc, wherever required.

The MORTH statement on Thursday said that some of these steps are being taken to rectify black spots. Besides, the NHAI, which is primarily responsible for constructing and managing national highways in India (NHIDCL and PWDs of states also manage them) has delegated financial power of up to Rs 50 crore to its regional officers to carry out rectification of black spots including land acquisition without sending files to NHAI headquarter for approval.

The ministry also said that it is taking traffic calming measures such as traffic warning signs, delineators, road studs, bar markings, humps at approach roads, etc, at vulnerable sections of National Highways to reduce road accident fatalities.

Is there a connection between black spots and accidents?

Earlier in the story, we looked at the states and regions which account for the maximum number of road accidents in national highways and expressways, now let us take a look at the concentration of black spots in the national highways and expressways from 30 states and UTs, data for which has been collected by MORTH's Transport Research Wing (TRP).

Region States Black spots South Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Goa, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Puducherry 2,493 East West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand 992 North West Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi and Rajasthan 967 North Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand 459 Central Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh 445 West Gujarat, Maharashtra, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu 304 North East Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura 143 Grand Total 5,803 SOURCE: Press Information Bureau, Government of India

As it's clear from the data above, national highways and expressways in south India account for the maximum number 2,493 of black spots -- nearly 43 percent of the 5,803 identified by the TRP.

While the concentration of black spots in other regions does not follow the same pattern as road accidents (check table at the top), the concentration of black spots is located majorly in five regions -- south, east, north-west, north and central -- which also reported the maximum number of road accidents.

Going beyond the national highways, expressways

India reported a total of 4,49,002 accidents in the year 2019. These accidents led to 1,51,113 accidental deaths and 4,51,361 accidental injuries. Based on recent data released by MORTH, of the nearly 4.5 lakh accidents that took place in 2019, 1,37,191 or 30.5 percent occurred in national highways and expressways.

These figures are indeed a matter of concern for the MORTH which owns the national highways, especially given the low distribution of the national highways -- the NHs accounted for just 1.94 percent of India's total roads as of 2017. But the situation on the flipside (other roads) seems just as alarming.

The remaining roads -- state highways (2.97 percent), district (9.94 percent), rural (70.65 percent) and urban roads (8.93 percent) and project roads (5.58 percent) -- are likely to be where the remaining 69.5 percent road accidents might be taking place.

While the MORTH's focus on improving black spots in national highways and expressways is a crucial initiative that needs to be completed on priority. Any initiative to reduce road accidents in India will be incomplete if it fails to include the state highways, district roads, rural roads.

MORTH didn't release any data related to road safety initiatives on these roads on Thursday.

Also, given the existing regional disparities in the national highway network in India, and the concentration of traffic-related injuries to a few states or regions, a localised approach may be more suited.","While 1,40,843 road accidents were reported in national highways and expressways in 2018, they fell to 1,37,191 in 2019.

572,India had most deaths in road accidents in 2019: Report,"A total of 151,113 people were killed in 480,652 road accidents across India in 2019, an average of 414 a day or 17 an hour, according to a report by the transport research wing of the ministry of road transport and highways.

India continued to have the most road fatalities in the world, followed by China, a distant second at 63,093 deaths in 2,12,846 road accidents in 2019, the report revealed. The United States of America (USA) reported the most road accidents at 2,211,439, and witnessed 37,461 deaths in 2019.

According to the report, speeding was the leading cause of deaths, while, in terms of vehicles, two-wheelers were involved in most road fatalities.

Across states, most road accidents were reported in Tamil Nadu (57,228), followed by Madhya Pradesh (50,669), Uttar Pradesh (42,572), Kerala (41,111) and Karnataka (40,658) accidents.

Maharashtra ranked sixth with 32,295 accidents, but saw the second-highest number of fatalities (12,788), after 22,655 in Uttar Pradesh.

Among cities, Delhi retained its first rank with 1,463 deaths, followed by Jaipur (1,283), Chennai (1,252) and Bengaluru (768).

Mumbai ranked ninth with 447 people being killed in road accidents in 2019.

The report stated that national and state highways, which account for just five per cent of the total roads in the country, saw the most deaths ‚Äî 61% of the total.

Two-wheelers were involved in 37% of the road deaths in the country, followed by pedestrians at 17% and light vehicles (comprising cars, jeeps and taxis) at 16%. A total of 56,136 people riding two-wheelers lost their lives, while 25,858 pedestrians died in 2019, stated the report.

The report stated that speeding accounted for most road accidents and deaths (ranging between 63% and 73% for accidents and between 62% and 70% for deaths) on all categories of national highways.

In 2019, like in previous years, young adults in the age group of 18-45 years accounted for nearly 69.3% of road accident deaths, while those in the age group of 18 ‚Äì 60 accounted for 84.3%.

Interestingly, it wasn‚Äôt curved roads that took the most lives ‚Äî 96,624 people lost their lives on straight roads, while curved roads saw 20,141 deaths.

‚ÄúTraditionally, for any accident or crash, the major causes could be ‚Äòdriver/human‚Äô, ‚Äòroad infrastructure‚Äô or ‚Äòvehicle-related factors‚Äô. Sometimes, there might be combinations of these factors which might lead to accidents. Among these major factors, ‚Äòdriver/human‚Äô-related factors or errors dominate,‚Äù said Nagendra R Velaga, associate professor (transportation systems engineering), department of civil engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay. Examples of such human/driver factors include ‚Äî rash driving, fatigue/sleep deprivation (particularly for long-haul truck drivers), speeding (due to certain reasons like time pressure or time constraints to reach the destination), on-board distractions (eg: using digital devices such as mobile phones while driving), driving under influence of alcohol and drugs, among other, said Velaga.

‚ÄúAdvanced technologies and artificial intelligence can control some human errors or driver factors (for example, camera-based speed-detection system). However, I strongly feel that it is the individual‚Äôs responsibility to respect their own life use required and appropriate precautionary measures (use seatbelt and helmet, follow traffic rules, and do not use phone while driving, avoid rash driving and drunk driving),‚Äù added Velaga

Former chairman of the Supreme Court (SC) committee on road safety, retired justice KS Radhakrishnan, said speeding is the major cause of accidents, especially on straight roads and highways, where control on speed is minimal. On curved roads, speeding is less, due to which accidents are less. ‚ÄúCondition of roads, traffic violations, drink and drive, among others, are also major contributors to high number of fatalities and accidents,‚Äù said Radhakrishnan.

Radhakrishnan, whose committee conducted 250 meetings with the government, national highways authority, state traffic departments and international agencies, to curb accidents, said, ‚ÄúThe meetings are heading in the right direction,‚Äù said Radhakrishnan. ‚ÄúThe fine in India is not a deterrent,‚Äù said Radhakrishnan adding, ‚ÄúHowever, the average person here will not be able to afford heavy fines. The government will just end up seizing licences.‚Äù

To bring down fatalities, Velaga said, ‚ÄúIn addition to national-level policies and legislation, regional or local-level control strategies or measures are required. Strong enforcement is also required.‚Äù

Velaga also said, ‚ÄúCausal and impact analysis of accidents/crashes is required for state, regional and local level. More focus on research related to human/driver factors may be needed to understand the exact of factors influencing the crashes and suitable remedial measures.‚Äù

Commenting on the report, Piyush Tewari, CEO and founder, SaveLIFE Foundation said, ‚ÄúThere is an urgent need for full implementation of the road safety provisions in the motor vehicle (amendment) Act 2019, including implementation of child safety provisions.

573,Road accident scenario more 'dangerous' than Covid in India: Gadkari,"NEW DELHI: Terming road accident scenario in India more ""dangerous than COVID-19 pandemic"", Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday said there could be a saving of Rs 90 lakh per person by preventing deaths and reducing injuries to minor ones in such incidents.The minister stressed that the accident cost as a tremendous burden to society and the nation and the estimated cost of a death in a road accident is around Rs 91.16 lakh.Releasing the World Bank report on 'Traffic Crash Injuries And Disabilities: The Burden on India Society', prepared in association with Save Life Foundation, Road Transport , Highways and MSMEs Minister Gadkari said in this alarming scenario his ministry will formulate policies to protect the interest of the poor and embark on several reformative steps.India accounts for the highest number of road accidents globally, with 1.5 lakh people being killed and more than 4.5 lakh crippled annually in 4.5 lakh road accidents with losses amounting to 3.14 per cent of the GDP.""For Government, each life is precious whether that is from poor or rich family, urban or rural area, male or female and at any level of society. The situation is alarming... there are more deaths than in COVID-19...It is more dangerous than COVID-19,"" Gadkari said terming the World Bank report an eye-opener.In India cost per seriously injured person comes at Rs 3.64 lakh while cost per minor injured person stands at Rs 77, 938 and the cost per death is estimated at Rs 91.16 lakh, he said.""So death cost is 100 times more than injury cost. It shows that if we succeed in preventing deaths in a road accident and restrict the life of accident victims to minor injuries only, we can save around Rs 90 lakh per person,"" the minister said addressing the event.""We needed to change law and make special policies. Accident cost as a tremendous burden to society and nation. There are lots of lapses in the legal system, police system. We need to protect the poor,"" he said adding that policy interventions are on the anvil apart from a number of steps, already initiated by his ministry.Around 70 per cent of deaths are in the working-age group of 18 to 45 years old while India accounts for 415 deaths per day in road accidents.Emphasising road safety audits, besides audit of detailed project reports, engineering plans and schemes pertaining to the injured, the minister said various audits can correct deficiencies causing accidents.Earlier, 40,000 km of highways have been brought under auditing.The minister said IITs and engineering colleges could take up highway stretches for road safety audit with some financial aid while third-party road safety audits will help in finding engineering faults and correcting them.Emphasising that his ministry was one such ministry which did not believe in protecting the wrong-doers and was transparent, the minister said there is a need that DPRs should be proof-checked and revised by competent authorities, third-party agencies, and educational institutions before implementation.He urged states to replicate Tamil Nadu model which could reduce road accidents by 38 per cent and deaths by 54 per cent and added 78 per cent of road accident deaths are of two-wheeler riders, bicyclists and pedestrians and protection and safety of these vulnerable road user groups is the foremost priority of the Centre.Gadkari further said the chairman of the National Road Safety Council will be announced soon as this body will be responsible for collecting accident data and suggesting measures to further reduce road accidents.Stressing that 70 per cent of accident deaths In India are due to over-speeding, the minister said fitness check of all vehicles has been mandated through Automated Vehicle Inspection and Certification (I&C) centres.Gadkari also said it is essential that automobile manufacturers should further enhance safety features.Broadly, the Report says that road accidents are a tremendous burden to society and the nation and states and reducing accident deaths and injuries can boost income growth and large welfare gains can be achieved from proven cost-effective road safety interventions.The minister said road accident deaths and injuries strike down prime working-age adults in low and middle-income countries and added that accidents are a public health issue and challenge in countries like India.Gadkari said the government is working with the World Bank on various projects, one of which is to streamline the road crash database that is iRAD.Pointing out that one of the key findings of the report is that the number of accident deaths is double in poor families as compared to rich ones, he said it is very important to have a streamlined and robust and accessible legal, insurance and healthcare ecosystem.The minister said that recommendations of the report on the safety of vulnerable road users, cashless treatment, improvement of civic and health infrastructures, penetration and compensation mechanism of insurance, post-crash response ecosystem and integration of stake-holders would help in revising the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act 2019 and Motor Vehicle rules.The World Bank report comes even as the country is observing an extended first-ever ‚ÄúRoad Safety Month‚Äù currently to build awareness of road safety.","""For Government, each life is precious whether that is from poor or rich family, urban or rural area, male or female and at any level of society.

576,"Road accidents, deaths drop by over 20% in 2020 partly due to Covid-19: Gadkari","India has recorded a significant drop in road crashes and deaths in the first three quarters of calendar 2020 against same time in 2019. This is partly due to COVID-19 pandemic-prompted lockdowns and people voluntarily not venturing out to prevent transmission.

""India has seen a 26.48 per cent reduction in road accidents and a 22 per cent drop in deaths in 2020 against 2019‚Ä¶. COVID-19 has contributed to this reduction in accidents and deaths,"" Nitin Gadkari, Minister for Road Transport and Highways, said in a road safety conference.

Road Ministry sources later said the data refers to January to September 2020 against same-period 2019.

India, which loses almost 1.5 lakh lives every year on account of road accidents, is revising its target to drop the extent of road fatalities by half by 2025 or earlier, instead of the earlier target of 2030, said Gadkari. He cited Tamil Nadu's example recording a continuous drop in road accidents and deaths in the last three-four years.

""It's okay to miss road construction target, but we should try and meet the target of saving lives from road accidents and deaths earlier‚Ä¶,"" said Gadkari, pointing out that targeting reduction by half means seeing 75,000 deaths every year till 2030.

Reasons for drop

Other contributors to a drop in road crashes include India strengthening road safety measures like increasing penalties for traffic accidents; fixing and redesigning 'blackspots' or spaces identified with large accidents where road design could be changed; bringing in vehicle-safety parameters among others.

States like Tamil Nadu and some highway developers have lowered deaths and accidents through focused interventions like CCTVs surveillance, electronic-challans, and making road safety.

Tamil Nadu has seen fatalities from road accidents drop to 7,278 (for 11 months up to November) in 2020, against 17,218 deaths in 2016; road accidents have dropped to 40,725 (in 11 months of 2020) against 71,431 in 2016; and grievous injuries were down to 3,205 (11 months, 2020) against 82,163 in 2016.

According to Maj Gen (Retd) Pawan Anand, Secretary-General, Highway Operators' Association of India (HOAI), a body of highway operators and maintainers, the road developers have taken specific interventions like smoothening the sharper curves on highways and seen a significant drop in crashes. More lighting on several highways also resulted in a decline in accidents, said Anand. One of the national highway stretches -- Dharmavaram-Rajahmundri -- saw a 48 per cent drop in deaths and 20 per cent drop in crashes in three years of 2015-2018.

In another move, Uber, along with Lenskart, will provide free or subsidised spectacles to drivers, it was announced.

All-round awareness

Rajnath Singh, Defence Minister, called for all-round awareness to lower accidents, adding that he had asked his driver to speed up that resulted in an accident. Singh said that the Covid-19 pandemic has led to over 1.5 lakh deaths in about 11 months; road accidents result in as many deaths every year, indicating the scale of the challenge.","""India has seen a 26.48 per cent reduction in road accidents and a 22 per cent drop in deaths in 2020 against 2019‚Ä¶.

577,India saw 13% decline in fatal road accidents in 2020: Nitin Gadkari informs Parliament,"Representational image

Around 3,66,138 road accidents took place in India in 2020, causing 1,31,714 deaths. The figure was around 13 percent lower than the corresponding number for 2019, which saw 1,51,113 deaths due to road accidents in India, Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari said in a written response in Lok Sabha on August 5.

One must note here, one of the reasons behind the sharp decrease in the number of road accidents in 2020 was partially due to the coronavirus pandemic outbreak, which forced the entire nation into months of strict lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. During this time, the movement of vehicles -- commercial and private -- was highly regulated.

Giving further details on road accidents in India, the Road Transport Minister informed the Lok Sabha that Tamil Nadu recorded the highest number of road accidents followed by West Bengal and Karnataka.

He added that road accidents in India occur mainly due to speeding, drunken driving, driving on the wrong side, lane indiscipline, use of mobile phones while driving, mechanical defect, faulty vehicle, bad roads, bad weather, and lack of knowledge on road signage.

Gadkari pointed out that now road safety has been made an integral part of road design at the planning stage.

""The ministry has delegated powers to regional officers of MoRTH for technical approval of the detailed estimates for rectification of identified road accident black spots,"" he said.

While addressing the issue, Gadkari also said that his ministry has devised a multi-pronged strategy to address the road safety issues. The strategy will focus on education, road engineering, vehicle engineering, enforcement, and emergency care.

To minimise the number of road accidents, the Government of India has also imposed stricter punitive measures for violations of traffic rules under the new amended Motor Vehicles Act.","Representational imageAround 3,66,138 road accidents took place in India in 2020, causing 1,31,714 deaths.

580,"In India, six two-wheeler riders die every hour in road accidents","As two-wheelers become more popular in the absence of public transport, the number of road accidents involving these is also growing. More than a third (37%) of those killed in road accidents in 2019 were two-wheeler riders, noted a Ministry of Road Transport and Highways‚Äô report published in October this year.

More crashes and deaths are resulting from faulty licensing laws, no training, poor roads and unsafe helmets. Just correct helmet use could reduce the risk of fatal injuries by 42% and head injuries by 69%, a World Health Organization report said.

India needs stricter licensing laws and must ensure the use of proper helmets through effective communication and fines, experts told IndiaSpend. Mandatory and proper training for riding and handling two-wheelers is a must, as is an overall improvement in road infrastructure. Also, India must bolster public transport in order to reduce traffic.

Bike sales grow with income

As the gross national income per capita rises, the number of two-wheelers also increases. The poorer the country, the higher the growth, according to The United Nations Motorcycle Helmet Study published in 2016. An exponential, growth in a country‚Äôs two-wheeler fleet might result in a rapid increase in the number of motorcycle crashes.

India witnessed a rapid growth in per capita incomes in the last decade, which also led to people buying more vehicles ‚Äì particularly two-wheelers ‚Äì according to a study by the Institute for Social and Economic Change, Bangalore. India‚Äôs per capita income grew by 28% between 2013 and 2017 while two-wheeler registrations increased by 46% (compared to 44% overall new vehicle registrations) over the same period.

Last year, 2.12 crore two-wheelers were sold in India and the annual sales are projected to reach 2.66 crore units by 2025 at 2.6% growth rate, according to UnivDatos .

Alongside the increase in income and the subsequent rise in the number of vehicles, India also witnessed concrete or tarred surface road growth of 4.18% from 1951-2018 . However, all this has not been accompanied by a corresponding improvement in regulation and regulatory infrastructure necessary to protect and educate vulnerable road users, pointed out experts.

There is barely any education on road safety in India, said Vir Nakai, 41, a Mumbai-based motorcyclist and brand strategist for bike manufacturers.

‚ÄúSafety is not high on our agenda... whether it is issuing driving licences or formulating and enforcing traffic rules,‚Äù said Nakai, who has been riding motorcycles across the country for over two decades. ‚ÄúThat is the main reason why we have to deal with hazards like parked vehicles on main roads, people riding and driving on the wrong side, little regard for traffic lights and complete lack of lane discipline. Motorcyclists are a small thing on the road and no one cares about them.‚Äù

Together, two-wheelers and pedestrians account for 54% of accident-related deaths in India and are the most vulnerable category in line with global trends, according to the ministry report . While 37% of road accident deaths (56,136) ‚Äì or six every hour, on average ‚Äì involved two-wheelers, pedestrians made up 17% and cyclists 3%. There were 449,002 road accidents leading to 151,113 deaths, making Indian roads the deadliest in the world, the report noted. India accounts for 11% of the global road accident fatalities.

Mobility and motorcycles

Motorcycles and scooters, given their price-point and availability, are a convenient alternative to the inadequate public transport that exists outside of the big cities, said Nakai. The average commute time for surveyed two-wheeler riders in Pune was just about 30 minutes while commuting by public transport typically took much longer, found a 2014 research by World Resources Institute .

‚ÄúScooters or two-wheelers are seen more as family vehicles in rural and semi-urban areas,‚Äù said Bhargab Maitra, a professor of infrastructure design at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. ‚ÄúYou will see that bike sales are higher in these areas but enforcement of traffic laws is a lot more lax.‚Äù

‚ÄúMost places of work are in cities while the workers tend to stay in the suburbs as housing prices within the city are too high for many to afford,‚Äù said Tej Prakash Sinha, head of emergency medicine of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.

While cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata have metro and local train services and others such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai are developing their metro coverage, most of India does not have proper public transport services. Hence people are forced to travel long distances daily and bikes make the commute faster and easier, he added.

Poor licensing laws, little training

Vehicles driven by untrained and unqualified drivers are a serious traffic hazard. Road accidents involving drivers without a valid driving license increased from 37,585 in 2018 to 44,358 in 2019, an increase of 18%, and accounted for 9.9% of the total accidents, the transport ministry data showed.

‚ÄúAt least, car drivers do go through some level of training before they are issued a driving license in India,‚Äù said Piyush Tewari, founder of SaveLIFE Foundation . ‚ÄúThis is a missing factor for many two-wheeler riders. There is almost negligible training that people undergo in terms of crash prevention, road safety rules... they just learn how to operate the bike. So that is a major overall contributor to crashes.‚Äù

The ministry data also revealed that about 72% of road accidents involved drivers holding a valid driver license. Of 317 victims of traumatic brain injury from road accidents studied for a 2018 AIIMS paper , only two-thirds were carrying a ‚Äúformal driving license‚Äù; only one had a learner‚Äôs license.

The driving license for two-wheelers is almost a joke, said Nakai.

‚ÄúI took a written test for my driving licence and then drove in a car for the road test,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúAfter finishing my drive, the person assessing me noticed I had applied for both two-wheelers and cars. When I said I would drop off the car and come back with a bike in a few minutes, he said, ‚ÄòSince you can drive a car, you would know how to ride a motorcycle.‚Äô That was how it was.‚Äù

Given the kind of motorcycles available in the market now, such oversight in granting licences is dangerous. ‚ÄúMost riders in India do not have sufficient training to handle motorcycles like a KTM-390 (a powerful and very fast motorcycle) or other such bikes,‚Äù added Nakai. ‚ÄúThe skills needed to handle and ride these bigger bikes are very different from riding a basic motorcycle. One needs to undergo special training to be able to ride them safely. But, in India, if you have a driving license, it is a blanket permit to ride anything from a scooty to a Hayabusa [superbike] and here everybody gets a two-wheeler license.‚Äù

In contrast, Singapore has multi-tiered license categories and minimum age requirements corresponding to the power of the bikes. A Grade 1 license for 100cc bikes is issued at 18 years of age, and only after more training and at the age of 19 years one can apply for a Grade 2 for 150-200cc two-wheelers and a Grade 3 license for superbikes is issued at the age of 20, said Tewari. ‚ÄúAt the moment, a 19-year-old in India could get a learner‚Äôs license and drive a superbike, which is almost like a weapon in the hands of untrained youngsters,‚Äù he said.

Road infrastructure and vehicle design

Suchi Vora, 34, an architect in Pune, has been riding two-wheelers since she was 16 even though she started learning how to ride one when she was a 13-year-old like many of her peers did at the time in her hometown. The roads on which she started riding in the 1990s have come a long way and are much improved today, she said.

‚ÄúThe city‚Äôs road and infrastructure have advanced tremendously from the time I first started riding but they have become more dangerous too,‚Äù said Vora. ‚ÄúThe city roads are a patchwork at best. They are uneven and riddled with potholes, which are practically deathtraps. There are more people speeding on our streets and the traffic has become a lot worse compared to the improvement in city roads. In the outskirts, the roads are still pretty bad. I do not feel safe taking my scooty to far away places‚Ä¶ I use a car. There is always someone coming from the wrong side or jumping signals. You never know what could hit you if you switch off even for a minute.‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo-wheelers are becoming more fuel efficient and hence their popularity is high in both rural and urban areas,‚Äù said Maitra of IIT. ‚ÄúThe road infrastructure is growing as well but it is not keeping pace with the growing number of vehicles and also the quality of the road infrastructure is not up to the mark.‚Äù

On national highways, on average, driving on the wrong side of the road caused 5.2% and drunken driving led to 3.7% of the accidents, according to the government report.

‚ÄúOur road infrastructure is not very forgiving, one violation could lead to an accident,‚Äù added Maitra. ‚ÄúThis is especially true in the case of two-wheeler drivers. Even though cars also violate rules, they are at least protected by the vehicle in some ways.‚Äù

While road and infrastructure development has been sluggish, two-wheelers have evolved at a much faster pace and the current vehicles available in India are far more efficient, powerful and speedier than the scooters that the majority used to ride in the 1990s, experts and bikers told IndiaSpend. ‚ÄúWhile the scooters and bikes of the 1990s used to struggle to accelerate, motorcycles available in India today have become a lot faster,‚Äù said Nakai. ‚ÄúTwo-wheeler development has far outpaced infrastructure development in our country.‚Äù

This is where road and vehicle design clash. The current speed limit in the country is 80 km/h on a four-lane highway. Even the entry-level 100cc motorcycles hit speeds of 80 km/h without much trouble.

Overspeeding caused, on average, 71.6% of all road accidents on national highways, the Central report said. If the speed limit on our roads is reduced to about 55 km/h -57 km/h, we could save around 30% to 37% lives, according to an advisor to the WHO, as IndiaSpend reported .

Helmets and trauma injury

Almost everyone in India who has ridden a bike or scooter has done so without a helmet at least once in their lives, noted Nakai. ‚ÄúA huge number of bikers do not wear a helmet and among those who wear one, a lot of the helmets are of poor quality,‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúAgain, this is because of our attitude towards safety. We do not take safety seriously.‚Äù Not wearing helmets resulted in deaths of 44,666 (30,148 drivers and 14,518 pillions) or 29.82% of total road accident fatalities during 2019, according to the ministry data .

Correct helmet use can lead to a 42% reduction in the risk of fatal injuries and a 69% reduction in the risk of head injuries according to the WHO . ‚ÄúOftentimes, we have seen that it [death] is because of either not wearing a helmet or wearing a very poor quality helmet,‚Äù said Tewari. ‚ÄúAnother challenge is implementing the helmet rule and availability of affordable and quality helmets right now.‚Äù

581,Opinion: Pedestrian infrastructure cannot be euphemism to help car traffic,"Hyderabad: Pedestrians deaths are increasing in Hyderabad due to various accidents, poor infrastructure, and lack of safe pavements. As per a report by The Footpath Initiative, 602 pedestrians lost their lives on the roads of Hyderabad between 2017 and 2019. More than half of them (52.4%) were hit by vehicles while crossing the road. A few others were victims of road crashes as they went about their morning walk, or while waiting for a bus or other modes of transport by the side of the road. And at least 14 children, all under 10 years of age, got hit by vehicles while playing by the roadside during this period. At least one pedestrian life in Hyderabad was lost every other day in 2019. This situation of pedestrians in Hyderabad and other cities of Telangana is no different from the national conditions.

As per the 2011 Census, one-third of all work trips are by foot with data showing that women tend to walk more than men. According to the National Statistical Organization (NSO), 60% of children walk to school. Despite this, walking infrastructure is inadequate and even non-existent in most of the cities which have seen steady growth in pedestrian fatalities. According to the report ""Road Accident Data in India"" published by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highway, 17% of the total road crash fatalities are pedestrians with 25,858 killed in 2019. Data shows that this number has increased by 85% in five years.

A large number of open manholes and damaged slabs on roadside drains have become death traps for pedestrians in Hyderabad. GHMC has been building toilets on footpaths. Electricity poles and transformers on footpaths also endanger pedestrians. Railings on footpaths and medians constrain pedestrians. People will not resort to jumping medians if we provide adequate crossings where they need them.

Road crossing has become a dangerous pursuit. With Hyderabad Metro Rail raising an almost two feet wall in the road median, pedestrians are finding it difficult to cross the roads. In general, pavements are either narrow, damaged, or occupied, forcing pedestrians to walk on the roads, making them vulnerable to accidents. Road widening has never helped in expanding pavement widths. Parallel and hazardous parking is further forcing pedestrians to walk on the road.

Pedestrian-friendly places don't need elaborate infrastructure. The so-called ""pedestrian"" infrastructure is created because of the presence and primacy of cars. Its purpose is primarily to benefit cars and speeding car travel. If any pedestrian walks outside a pavement, or against light, the law routinely exempts vehicle drivers from any penalties from hitting or killing them. Elaborate and expensive pedestrian bridges are at best a remedial effort to minimize the danger this environment poses to anyone who isn't in a car. They don't really make the area any more desirable for walking. The real problem is not the infrastructure, or lack thereof, but a built environment that's inhospitable to walking and cycling.

In 2018, it was reported that the government of Telangana has given permission for the construction of 52 foot-over-bridges (FOB) and eight skywalks in the Greater Hyderabad limits. Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR), in 2014, promised that as many as 200 skywalks (elevated walk space) below the metro rail viaduct under the project. Almost all of these plans are on paper, not yet realized. A few foot-over-bridges constructed here and there remain unutilized or under-utilized. The government should undertake a serious study on why these FOBs are not being used. Pedestrian infrastructure should be planned for them. It cannot be a euphemism to help car traffic.

A national coalition of NGOs (including Hyderabad-based Citizens for a Better Public Transport) has launched a nationwide campaign to demand that the government of India declared 11 January as National Pedestrians' Day. The campaign highlights the need for safe, convenient, and pleasant walking infrastructure in the country and to develop a culture where pedestrians are respected.

National campaign coordinator SurajJaipurkar said, ""We have launched this campaign to highlight the alarming rise in pedestrian fatalities. Streets and walking neighbourhoods should be strengthened and made safe and inclusive in such a way that it accommodates all types of road users - from children to senior citizens to differently-abled people.""

RanjitGadgil from Parisar added, ""National days serve as occasions to raise awareness about an issue, mobilize grassroots support through actions, garner media attention, and thus create political will to address it.""

As part of the campaign, SUM Net partners will meet decision-makers in order to solicit their support for the declaration of a National Pedestrians' Day and to push for policies that will make walking attractive and safe. They also plan to organize activities like rallies, walkathons, and seminars to highlight the importance of walkability. They have called upon other organizations to join the campaign and a draft resolution for Pedestrians' Day will also be submitted to the government.

On 9 October 2021, in a letter to Arvind Kumar, the special chief secretary of the government of Telangana, Citizens for a Better Public Transporturged him to declare a Pedestrian Week in the GHMC area and celebrates Pedestrian Day in Telangana cities. Dr. Narasimha Reddy Donthi, in this letter, suggested the development of a Telangana Pedestrian First policy (through consultations), development of guidelines to integrate this policy in urban master plans, and road network development. Dr. C. Ramachandraiah added, ""Walkability needs a huge mindset change among the government officers and consultants who are creating project reports.""

The letter, further, requested GHMC to declare selected roads only for pedestrians and prevent vehicles from playing for a declared period of time, just like in Tank Bund.

Incidentally, Pune has become the first city in the country to declare a city-level pedestrian day. The Pune Municipal Corporation recently announced that it will observe Pedestrians' day on 11 December.

Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) constituted for Hyderabad in 2008, has to prioritize the needs of pedestrians.

Our suggestions:

Declaration of a Telangana Pedestrian Day Telangana government should write a letter to the Union government urging a declaration of 11Januaryevery year as National Pedestrians' Day. Hyderabad, and other major cities in Telangana, have to focus their attention on pedestrians. Retrofitting existing roads with pedestrian-friendly pavements should be part of this activity celebrating walking, walkers, and pedestrians. Eventually, selected road stretches can be declared for a certain period of the day, in a week, as vehicle-free. A similar approach can be adopted in other cities of Telangana. The pedestrianization of streets should be part of GHMC and MAUD plans.

We have to be more ambitious and set targets to achieve zero pedestrian deaths in our cities and urban areas. We need deliberate strategies to boost the safety, feasibility, and allure of walking.","Hyderabad: Pedestrians deaths are increasing in Hyderabad due to various accidents, poor infrastructure, and lack of safe pavements.

583,Road accidents in India are like silent pandemic: Rajnath Singh,"Voicing his concerns over rising road accidents, Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said India accounts for nearly 11 per cent of the total road accidents in the world and it is no less than a silent pandemic.

Addressing the 'Karmayogis' of Border Road Organisation (BRO) via video conferencing, the Union Defence Minister said, ""Accidents on the roads are a cause of great concern for us today. It is a matter of great surprise that our country has less than 3 per cent of the world's total vehicles, but accidents are close to 11 per cent. Every year around 4.5-5 lakh accidents and 1.5 lakh unfortunate deaths occur in the country. It is not less than a silent pandemic.""

""To get rid of all this, whatever steps the government has taken, such as approving the 'National Road Safety Policy', bringing in the 'Motor Vehicle Act 2020', identifying black spots on national highways...these centres also have their own importance,"" he said.

BRO on Friday launched four new software for works management, road infrastructure digitisation, human resource management and recruitment management.

""The four software being launched today will bring efficiency to the work of the organization and will also save their time. Their creation also marks the success of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' and 'Digital India' campaigns,"" stated Singh.

The Union Defence Minister said the start of two 'Centres of Excellence' based on the study of 'Road Safety', and roads, bridges, tunnels, air-fields is a matter of great pride for the country. He said these centres complement each other in their objectives.

""Right from its inception, BRO has been playing a vital role in the progress of the nation by building roads, tunnels and other infrastructure in remote areas. The most important component is connectivity. For connectivity, our BRO personnel have been working tirelessly even in the midst of difficulties like severe winter, heat, rain, snowfall. In the last 5-7 years, BRO has made even more remarkable achievements,"" he said.

He emphasised the increase in the budget of BRO by three to four times during the last five to seven years is not a trivial matter. Apart from this, 3,270 sets of special high altitude clothing are approved for our engineers and other personnel.

The Union Defence Minister further mentioned the slogans like ""Sawdhani hati durghatna ghati"" also helps making people aware while on road.

Singh further extended his best wishes to woman biker Kanchan for her solo expedition.

""I feel good knowing about Kanchan ji who is going to start solo women motorcycle expedition today. I was told that at an early age she started riding a motorcycle. So far she has covered 21,000 km in 10 years. I wish her all the best for this expedition,"" he said.

584,Why India's new traffic law failed to curb road accidents,"Just over a year ago, dramatic traffic penalties under the amended Motor Vehicles Act made headlines across the country. The centre claimed the fines would curb road accidents. But latest government data show the reality was mixed and the fear of the law may have fizzled out quite soon.

A total of 154,732 people died on Indian roads in 437,396 accidents last year, the National Crime Records Bureau‚Äôs (NCRB‚Äôs) latest update shows. Around 139,000 of these accidents took place after the increased penalties kicked in on 1 September, 2019. Compared to the same period in 2018, this was a 4% drop.

But a closer look shows the decline was the sharpest (7.5%) in September, and began tapering October onward. A year-on-year comparison adjusts for seasonal effects since September anyway sees the fewest road accidents every year.





The NCRB gets the data on accidents and accidental deaths from state police bureaus. Due to underreporting, actual death counts could be 47-63% higher than official data, according to IIT Delhi‚Äôs Transportation Research and Injury Prevention Programme.

The World Health Organization‚Äôs estimate of accident deaths in India in 2016 was two times the government tally. This analysis focuses largely on accidents in cities, where reporting is typically better.

‚ÄúWhen the new law was announced, a lot of people suddenly started behaving on the road, such as stopping much before the zebra crossing and so on,"" said Piyush Tewari, chief executive officer of road safety nonprofit SaveLIFE Foundation. But within weeks, the deterrence factor got lost, and the situation has ‚Äúgone back to what it was"", he said.

Kamal Soi, a member of the centre‚Äôs National Road Safety Council, agreed the impact fizzled out ‚Äúa little"" and said enforcement agencies needed to keep up the momentum. Results can be expected only if the rules are enforced rigorously for at least 18 months, he said.

Gaps in implementation varied by state. Some of the most accident-prone cities and states reported a more sustained decline September onwards, but others did not. Due to public anger and political concerns, some states‚Äîeven those ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party‚Äîdecided to delay or reduce the fines. For instance, Gujarat‚Äôs penalties are lower than the centrally mandated ones, and Odisha implemented them only in March 2020.

States have to ‚Äúenforce the rules not for the central government, but for their own citizens"", Soi said. ‚ÄúStates that are not applying it are risking lives,"" he added.





Deaths due to dangerous driving and overspeeding‚Äîthe biggest killers on Indian roads‚Äî increased in 2019. As many as 128,798 people lost their lives due to dangerous driving and overspeeding‚Äî83% of all road accident deaths, the NCRB data showed. This was a 2.2% rise since 2018.

In the new regime, the recommended penalty for overspeeding ranges between ‚Çπ1,000 and ‚Çπ4,000, depending on vehicle type. Dangerous driving is punishable with at least six months in prison, or a fine of ‚Çπ1,000 to ‚Çπ10,000, or both.

But only three of the six most accident-prone states‚ÄîMaharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh‚Äîwere able to reduce accidents due to dangerous driving and overspeeding. These three states, along with Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala, report the most road accidents year after year. Last year, these six accounted for 58% of all road accidents in India.





Most road accident deaths take place on national and state highways, even though they make up just about 5% of the Indian road network. In India‚Äôs 53 most populous cities, highways have a 42% share in accident deaths, but this rises to 62% in the rest of India, shows the data. This could be because of higher traffic density in cities, leading to lower speeds, Soi said.

There were 113 accidents for each 100 km of national highways, 61 on state highways, and just four on other roads.





The risk on highways can be mitigated through electronic enforcement, which is mandated by the Section 136A of the Motor Vehicles Act, and touted by the centre as one of the key features of the 2019 amendments. But very few states are using it, Tewari said.

Road accidents cost India dearly. The age group of 18 to 45 is involved in 70% of them, shows government data.

If India can halve the casualties in road accidents for 24 years, it can improve its per capita income by 14%, according to the World Bank.

India‚Äôs union roads minister Nitin Gadkari may have hoped that the new law will act as a strong deterrent. But the resistance from the rest of the political establishment seems to have diluted its impact. This year, the pandemic-induced lockdown may have saved many lives by taking traffic off our roads. But as traffic returns to usual levels across cities, the risks of accidental deaths are also likely to rise.

589,"In 2020, negligence caused 1.34 lakh road accident deaths in India: NCRB","In 2020, negligence caused 1.34 lakh road accident deaths in India: NCRB

That India has a poor track record when it comes to road safety is not news, though it continues to be quite heartbreaking. Anyway, the National Crime Records Bureau of India recently released a new report containing the number of the offences registered in 2020 under the IPC. These NCRB stats for road accidents in India from last year show that 133,715 people were killed in 120,176 road accidents caused due to negligence. This category is organized across two sub-categories of accidents: Hit and run and others. A total of 45,229 people were killed in 41,196 hit and run cases in 2020. The report also mentions 'other' accidents, i.e. ones other than hit and run accidents, killed 88,486 people.

Among states, Uttar Pradesh fared the worst, recording a total of 17,513 accidents, which killed 19,205 people.

These stats, admittedly, show a decline in the number of such accidents and deaths, we must not forget that the country spent a large part of 2020 under lockdown. So, with people confined to their homes, a decline in such numbers would make sense. Or perhaps we are indeed starting to take road safety seriously around here. Who knows.

Amar Srivastava, founder of India Road Safety Campaign and member of the National Road Safety Council, said, ""Everyone expected road deaths will reduce significantly in 2020 due to lockdown and restrictions on movement across the country. But the final data doesn‚Äôt reflect this. So, we need to find solutions based on scientific studies and evidence. Going by this report, the number of deaths due to all road crashes may be higher when the NCRB comes out with the reports on deaths due to accidents.""","In 2020, negligence caused 1.34 lakh road accident deaths in India: NCRBThat India has a poor track record when it comes to road safety is not news, though it continues to be quite heartbreaking.

590,Watch | All about road accidents in India,"A video explainer on India's battle with road accidents in numbers

Road accidents are the leading cause of death among people in the 5-29 age-group worldwide according to a World Health Organisation report.

More than 1.35 million lives are lost each year and 50 million people sustain injuries. Globally, road accidents are the tenth leading cause of death.

India accounts for about 5 lakh road accidents annually, one of the highest in the world, in which about 1.5 lakh people die and another 3 lakh become crippled.

Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways V.K. Singh has said that around 71% of 4.49 lakh road accidents in India in 2019 were due to over speeding.

According to experts, the main causes of road accidents in India are rapid urbanisation, poor safety, lack of enforcement, distracted drivers, influence of drugs or alcohol, speeding and a failure to wear seat-belts or helmets.

There has been a 10% reduction in the number of deaths caused due to accidents in the country since the passage of the amended Motor Vehicles Act, said Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari.

He said the government has pledged to reduce 50% accidents in the next five years, and India is a signatory to this at the World Safety Conference held in Sweden recently.

Among various steps being taken to reduce accidents, the government proposes to open 1,000 driving schools in the country.

In 2020, the government launched a central accident database management system known as the Integrated Road Accident Database that will help in analysing causes of road crashes and in devising safety interventions to reduce such accidents in the country.","A video explainer on India's battle with road accidents in numbersRoad accidents are the leading cause of death among people in the 5-29 age-group worldwide according to a World Health Organisation report.

591,Plying of heavy vehicles during unscheduled hours on in city,"Ajay Joshi

Tribune News Service

Jalandhar, October 14

It‚Äôs been over a month since Tejinder Kaur, a 27-year-old woman lost her life in a road accident near the Maqsudan-DAV College road. She was reportedly crushed-to-death under the wheels of a speeding truck.

While, her family, which resides at Lidhran village, and her husband, who is settled abroad, have still not come out of the trauma, no lesson has been learnt by the authorities concerned. The movement of heavy vehicles goes unabated on the route. Flouting the 8 am to 8 pm rule, trucks and other heavy vehicles can be easily spotted on the road during the daytime.

The truck driver, who hit the woman, was drunk at the time of the accident. Besides, he was driving heavy vehicle on the road during unscheduled hours as the accident took place around 10.30 am. The deceased was heading to her salon in Model Town on her Activa scooter.

While mentioning the traffic guidelines, the SHO, police division No. 1, Inspector Ashwinder Singh Siddhu, said, ‚ÄúHeavy vehicles have been given relaxation to ply on city roads from 11 am to 1 pm. The rule is being flouted as vehicles use the road throughout the day.‚Äù

Jimmy Singh, a resident of Seth Hukum Chand Colony said, ‚ÄúHeavy trucks and tractor-trailers obstruct the movement of traffic in the city. It‚Äôs difficult to drive when heavily-loaded trucks are on the road.‚Äù

Apart from accidents, commuters also stressed upon the damage overloaded trucks and trailers are causing to roads.

Despite the presence of traffic police, drivers manage to ply trucks on roads. After the accident, the police halted movement of trucks and tractor-trailers from Maqsudan Chowk to Workshop Chowk. But, after a few days heavy vehicles once again started plying on the road. In the past also, heavy vehicles have claimed many lives on the route.

Trucks coming from different cities and states usually move towards their destinations through the Maqsudan-DAV stretch only. Vehicles supplying vegetables and fruits to the city also use the same route.

Meanwhile, DCP Naresh Dogra assured to take strict action against transporters violating the norm.","The movement of heavy vehicles goes unabated on the route.

592,India's gig economy and the question of quality jobs,"In August this year, Zomato launched the Har Customer Hai Star ad-campaign on TV featuring Katrina Kaif and Hrithik Roshan with the obvious intention of communicating that every customer was as important as a celebrity customer.

While some called it creative, the majority felt that the campaign was an attempt to divert attention from the payouts and working conditions of its gig workforce. Similarly, the on and off protests by the drivers of cab aggregators and the delivery partners of e-commerce and food delivery companies also underlined some of the issues faced by the gig workers. Apart from criticism around the harsh working conditions, the quality of work and the temporary nature of engagement, absence of a social security net, long hours, delayed payouts, and needless pressure to maximize speed of delivery even at the risk of road accidents have all invited disapproval.

E-commerce in India is a nascent industry that is probably less than 13 years old. In this short period, it has captured the collective imagination of the nation. The covid-19 crisis has accelerated its adoption, and even die-hard fans of shopping at a physical store have switched to shopping online. The rapid growth, astronomical valuations and runaway success of this industry has drawn a mix of both admiration and loathing, some deserved and some undeserved.

Some of the concerns are fair and call for introspection on the part of e-commerce companies, and highlight the inconvenient truth‚Äîthe bigger an industry gets, and the more successful it is perceived to be, the more responsible and thoughtful it needs to be in everything it does. However, some of the criticism is unreasonable and could potentially lead to premature and unrealistic regulation, which in turn could harm the stakeholders including the gig workers.

To understand this issue holistically and take a balanced position, we need to step back a bit and look at some of the realities of India‚Äôs ‚Äòjobs problem‚Äô. If you forget where you came from and what got you here, you are likely to take the wrong decisions.

India is a demographically youthful nation, and every year between 17 and 20 million people look for jobs. This includes around 5 million people who are abandoning highly exploitative and less remunerative farm jobs every year to find employment in other sectors, mostly in the nearest urban districts. To put this in perspective, the information technology (IT) and business process outsourcing industry that has been the pride of the nation created, on an average, less than 200,000 jobs a year during its 25 years of existence. This is just a minuscule 1% of the total number of jobs that need to be created.

Let‚Äôs quickly do another interesting and back of the envelope calculation: India‚Äôs gross domestic product (GDP) is nearly $3 trillion and assuming a realistic annual growth rate of 6%, it translates into a GDP expansion of $180 billion a year. It‚Äôs a well-known fact that in India, the share of wages is around 50% of GDP. This amounts to $90 billion.

If you divide this by the number of jobs that need to be created every year (20 million), the average wage rate per job is ‚Çπ3.4 lakh per annum or roughly ‚Çπ28,000 per month. And given the fact that the really well-paying jobs (roughly 10% of the total) account for approximately 50% of the wages, it‚Äôs quite evident that a majority of jobs will pay significantly lower than the average of ‚Çπ28,000.

This is clearly borne out by data from the Central Statistics Office‚Äôs (CSO) report on jobs dated 15 September 2016. If the average wage rate of these 20 million new jobs had to be say ‚Çπ60,000 per month, the economy would have to be growing at a rate of 15% per annum. So, creating high paying jobs was never easy and will never be easy; and nor is it realistic that every one, or even a majority of the 20 million, will be employed in high paying jobs.

According to CSO, only about 17% of India‚Äôs workers are regular wage earners and less than 23% of Indian households have a regular wage earner. In other words, 77% of our households did not have a steady flow of income. Self-employed (46%) and casual labour (33%) together account for nearly 80% of the workforce and claimed to earn less than ‚Çπ10,000 per month. These are the realities that cannot be ignored.

Expecting a nascent industry to not only move the needle but also transform the conditions of the labour market overnight‚Äîby an order of magnitude‚Äîis both unrealistic as well as unfair. Anyone complaining about the quality of jobs being created by the e-commerce industry probably needs to spend some time understanding the history of job creation in India.

So, where are these 17-20 million youth being absorbed every year currently? Clearly there is large-scale under-employment. And frankly what many of the new-age platforms have done is nothing short of a miracle both in terms of creating jobs as well as paying a fair wage.

Why marketplaces matter

Neither skill nor knowledge is enough to ensure one generates income. Creating jobs is also dependent on the ability to channelize both skills and knowledge into developing products and services that customers are willing to pay for. And this in turn sets the wheels of the economy in motion.

Economic activity is akin to traffic on a busy highway. From time to time, bottlenecks develop along this highway that choke the traffic and slow it down to a crawl or even create a complete gridlock. It needs the right triggers to unlock these bottlenecks. At times, these triggers are a result of conscious and thoughtful planning, but mostly a result of innovative application of existing or new technology. Once a bottleneck is released, the traffic flows smoothly for a while until another choke point gets created elsewhere that may probably need a different trigger to de-bottleneck.

A series of these bottlenecks and choke points had collectively grid-locked India into a ‚Äòmiddle income trap‚Äô for decades. One of the innovations that removed some of these bottlenecks is efficient online ‚Äòmarketplaces‚Äô enabled by technology.

A startup such as the Urban Company is an example of a technology-powered marketplace for common services such as plumbing, carpentry, beauty, and house-cleaning, among others. They brought consumers and suppliers of services (based on skills) on a common platform and made the whole process of matching demand and supply pretty seamless.

Plumbers, for example, no longer have to depend upon word of mouth or other inefficient methods for sourcing business. Inefficiencies that existed in matching demand and supply prior to the advent of platforms like these resulted in consumers having to live with substandard services provided by poorly skilled workers. Further, these workers did not have an incentive to up-skill because they knew that the inefficiencies in the discovery process for skills left the customers vulnerable and without a choice. Another disincentive to up-skill was the fact that earning capacity had little or no relationship with skill levels.

Technology platforms created by companies such as Urban Company improved the discovery process multifold. Every instance of service on these platforms was rated by the consumer. Plumbers with higher consumer ratings were given more business and hence an opportunity to earn more. Plumbers, therefore, learned the value of up-skilling and paying, if necessary, to up-skill.

A higher payout

A user is prepared to pay for learning something if the linkages to the benefits of learning are straightforward. And a consumer of a service is willing to pay more for better quality of service if there is a consistent and reliable process of evaluating the capability of service providers. Most of these workers were always self-employed and even with these platforms, they operate in a gig mode which isn‚Äôt structurally different.

However, the earnings have gone up significantly because of the ease of discovery and predictable flow of business. Most platforms have compensation structures that result in payouts beyond the minimum wages specified by the government, and this has implications on what it does to the broader consumption story of the economy. Many of the more enterprising gig workers on Urban Company platform consistently make more than ‚Çπ50,000 a month.

It‚Äôs not just Urban Company. Many of the recent startups such as Ola, Uber, and a host of others have unconsciously kicked off a revolution in the skilling and earnings journey. Youth from rural India had been joining the Ola and Uber platforms in large numbers. Many of them had migrated from rural farmlands, where they were either unemployed or heavily under-employed, to the nearest city or town to sign up for driving lessons by paying a fee.

No one had to push or nudge them because they knew that there was a real job at the end of it that paid them far more than what they had been making earlier. When skilling is voluntary and driven by a free market mechanism, the outcomes are magical.

One might wonder why these platforms should be considered game-changing. The platforms, per se, did not create a product or service that did not exist before. Cab services always existed. Plumbers, beauticians, carpenters and technicians were always around selling their services.

What these platforms did was ‚Äòindustrialize‚Äô the services‚Äîindustrialization allowed effortless consumption and created structured mechanisms to scale services and service capabilities. And here, lies the power of de-bottlenecking a serious choke point.

This de-bottlenecking was sufficient for free market forces to take over subsequently and create systemic trends and scale. Elimination of a single large bottleneck results in activating a virtuous cycle of ‚Äòincome growth‚Äô for service providers.

This, in turn, results in ‚Äònew consumption‚Äô which, in turn, leads to creation of more goods and service providers. We have been seeing a lot of this.

In short, these platforms lowered the barriers for consumption and production, which is an essential lubricant for the wheels of economic activity. They also shortened the feedback cycles which are such powerful triggers in a free market. The shorter the gap between an action and reward (or penalty), the faster the system tunes in to the right rhythm. So, the idea of rating every transaction by the consumer on these platforms shortened the feedback loop and led to instant course corrections and alignment.

The road ahead

India‚Äôs labour movement is more than a century old and quite mature. Entrepreneurs, too, have periodically formed industry associations to protect their interests. One of the main reasons why the IT industry has been able to avoid the formation of unions has been because of abundant opportunities in a growing industry for the employees, coupled with a fair pay structure and good working conditions.

As far as the e-commerce industry is concerned, there are several obvious lessons that can contribute towards its growth, going ahead. For instance, companies cannot seek rising valuations, on the one hand, and treat their gig workers unfairly, on the other.

At the same time, it is not fair to paint the entire industry as exploitative or be unduly critical of the gig model which is actually a very good model. Many of the gig workers themselves would be reluctant to take up full time and fixed salaried jobs. Pushing for premature regulation is like throwing the baby out with the bath water.

And finally, it is unrealistic to expect the e-commerce industry to create jobs that are probably as well paying or as fulfilling as their more upmarket cousin‚Äîthe IT industry.

The state government also demanded that the Centre take up works of Madurai Western Ring Road, Coimbatore Half Ring Road and Coimbatore-Sathyamangalam Road at 6,600 crore.The roads that the state government wants to be converted to NHs are Tiruvannamalai-Kallakurichi (65km), Vallioor-Tiruchendur (70km), Kollegal-Hanur-MM Hills-Palar Road-TN border extended up to Mettur (30km), Palani-Dharapuram (31km), Arcot-Tindivanam (91km), Mettupalayam-Bhavani (98km), Avinashi-Mettupalayam (38km) and Bhavani-Karur (77km). ‚ÄúThe present condition of these roads needs immediate repairs/improvements to cater to the present day-to-day traffic. The roads are most important, connecting significant pilgrimage centres such as Tiruvannamalai, Tiruchendur and Palani and many trade and tourism centres. Upon upgradation, Kallakurichi-Tiruvannamalai and Arcot-Tindivanam roads will serve as the shortest routes to important pilgrimage centre Tirupathi/Tirumala,‚Äù minister E V Velu said in a representation to Union minister Nitin Gadkari.The 30-km-long Madurai Western Ring Road will connect AIIMS, Madurai-Cochin Road and Kodai Road, link the integrated Madurai bus stand at Mattuthavani and central vegetable and flower market with NH44 (Srinagar-Kanyakumari Road).

Between April 2016 and July 2021, 715 accidents took place, resulting in 169 fatalities and 309 major injuries.

595,Road accidents in Mumbai up by 15%: Data,"Road accidents in the city have increased by 15% during the past six months, as compared to the number of accidents during the corresponding period last year. Deaths due to accidents in the state have increased by 22% between January and June 2021, as compared to last year.

As per statistics compiled by the Maharashtra Highway Police, Nashik tops in deaths by accident, while Mumbai tops in people injured in accidents. However, the police said that the number of accident cases as compared to pre-Covid levels is 37% less in the city and 20% less in the state.

As per statistics, for the period of January to June 2021, there were around 14,245 accident cases reported in the state. In the same period, 6,708 accidental death were reported, while 10,879 people were injured.

‚ÄúMumbai contributed around 6.7% cases, with 956 accidents, 131 deaths and 809 people reported injured,‚Äù said a police officer from the state Highway Police department. From January to June 2020, the city had seen around 809 accident cases, in which around 141 people had died and around 822 people were injured.

However, the accident cases last year were less due to strict Covid-19 lockdown.

Most numbers of the fatalities in accidents happened in Nashik Rural jurisdiction with around 454 deaths, followed by Pune Rural with 418 deaths. Ahmednagar reported 367 deaths, Jalgaon 267, Solapur 255, Satara 243 and Nagpur 242 deaths.

‚ÄúWe have been continuously working on the factors and studying them to reduce the number of accidents, most importantly fatalities. We have identified several black spots and are working on them to correct the problems. We are making people aware of over-speeding, which is a major cause of accidents. Due to the pandemic, we can‚Äôt concentrate on drunk driving, which is another major problem. At several spots we have studied that people drive on the wrong side which is one of the important reasons for accidents,‚Äù said Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay, additional director general of police, traffic, Maharashtra.

Upadhyay said they have also trained 1,000 locals, like garage owners, toll booth staff, puncture shop owners and even some dhaba staffers as Mrityunjay Doot‚Äôs, to provide immediate relief and medical attention to accident victims.

If we compare the accident cases with 2019 figures, there are 20% fewer accident cases, 5% fewer deaths on roads and 30% less injured people.

In a normal year like 2019, there were around 32,925 accident cases in the state, 12,788 deaths and 28,628 injured people due to accidents, said Upadhyay.

Accident cases have decreased in cities like Buldhana, Palghar and Thane.

‚ÄúThis year due to several restrictions and local trains still being closed for people, they tend to come out for work via their private vehicles. Several mail express trains have been cancelled. Those wanting to travel outstation can‚Äôt travel without reservations. Hence, more people are using their private vehicles, leading to more accidents.

598,"Despite lockdown, no big drop in accidents, deaths on road during 2020 in Maharashtra","The coronavirus-induced lockdown shut down Maharashtra for the better part of 2020 but an analysis of the Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) data has found that while road accidents across the state dropped by a quarter from 2019, fatalities came down by just 10 per cent.

A total of 24,971 road accidents were reported in 2020 that left 11,569 people dead. Despite the lockdown restrictions on movement, accidents dropped 24 per cent, and fatalities remained high in comparison to 2019 when 32,925 crashes had led to 12,788 deaths.

Of the 10,773 fatal accidents, an average of over 1,000 accidents was reported in January and February alone. Between March and September, this number fell below a thousand. The lowest number of 282 fatal accidents was reported in April, causing 303 fatalities. The highest number of 1,368 accidents took place in December, in which 1,462 people were killed.

The reason behind this high number of accidents, a senior HSP official said, could be attributed to the high volume of vehicles on the road due to the discontinuance of the train services and speeding.

The massive numbers of people walking on the highways, trying to escape the Maharashtra lockdown and reach home in other dsitricts within Maharashtra or in other states, were also vulnerable to road accidents.

Across India, most of the horrific road accidents reported in 2020 were the ones that claimed the lives of migrant workers on their way back home on foot amid the lockdown, and Maharashtra was no exception. While the worst tragedy took place when a freight train mowed down 16 migrant workers walking on the tracks, four other labourers were crushed to death and three injured in the early days of the lockdown when a speeding truck ran over them at Bharol village in Virar on Mumbai-Ahmedabad Highway on March 28. The men were headed to their villages in Rajasthan on foot but had been turned back from the Maharashtra-Gujarat border. The truck hit them from behind.

According to the HSP road accident data for 2020 accessed by The Indian Express, of the total road accident fatalities in the state, 2,214 were pedestrians who died after being hit by vehicles ‚Äî the second-highest fatality after 5,868 two-wheeler riders who accounted for over half the total fatalities. Four-wheeler accidents, too, led to 1,576

fatalities.

A bulk of the fatalities (9,152 deaths or 79%) were caused by speeding. Another 3,160 deaths were reported in hit-and-run cases but the type of collision could not be ascertained in

these deaths.

The highest fatalities were reported from Pune rural (696 deaths in 1,230 accidents), Nashik rural (801 deaths in 1,239 accidents) and Ahmednagar (642 deaths in 1,225 accidents). At 1,812, Mumbai recorded the highest number of accidents in the state but fewer deaths at 349.

Dhawal Ashar of World Resources Institute (WRI), India, a non-profit group that works to prevent road accidents in Mumbai, said, ‚ÄúIt is a worrying trend in Pune rural if over one out of every two crashes are fatal, unlike Mumbai where it could be possibly ascribed to many factors, including the high vehicle density.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn Mumbai, the speed of vehicles is less as compared to highways and so the severity of accidents and injuries are more on highways. Further, in Mumbai trauma care is easily accessible but on highways, this is a major concern,‚Äù said Rajeev Choubey, risk management specialist of Resilient India, a non-profit group helping the state government to reduce accidents.","A total of 24,971 road accidents were reported in 2020 that left 11,569 people dead.

601,Data: 26 States/UTs report 18% less Road Accidents & 15% less Deaths in Lockdown year 2020,"Road Accidents have been the leading cause of death among young adult males in India. India is also the country with most road accident deaths among 199 different countries. Though the number of road accidents has reduced by around 10% in the last 10 years, the number of deaths has increased. In the lockdown year of 2020, 26 States/UTs that have reported complete data, saw 18% less Road Accidents & 15% less Deaths.

India is among the countries that reports the greatest number of road accidents in the world. Every year, thousands of road accidents are reported across India resulting in fatalities and severe injuries. Road injuries are the leading cause of death among young adult males in India. According to the WHO, in 2019, road injury was among the top 10 causes of deaths globally. More people lost their lives to road injuries than to tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, or liver cirrhosis. Road accidents are a socio-economic burden on the victims‚Äô households as well as on the economy. Unlike certain chronic illnesses and diseases, road injuries are preventable through effective interventions and stringent enforcement of rules, as most of them occur due to negligence, poor infrastructure, and carelessness.

An average of 1200+ road accidents were reported daily in India in 2019

Responding to a question in the parliament recently, the Union Government stated that the total number of road accidents in the country stood at 4,49,002 during 2019. Compared to 2018, the number has dropped by nearly 4%. The trend in the number of reported road accidents from 2010 as per the annual ‚ÄòRoad Accidents in India‚Äô report reveals that the least number of accidents were reported in 2019. In 2010, 5.28 lakh road accidents had taken place, and since then there has been a gradual decrease in the number of such accidents. Between 2010 & 2019, there has been a 10% reduction in the number of road accidents. The data is based on information supplied by the Police Departments of States and UTs. Hence, the actual number of accidents may be higher.

According to data presented in the Lok Sabha earlier this year, 26 states/UTs had submitted data for the entire calendar year 2020. The data indicated that the total number of accidents in these 26 states/UTs had dropped by around 48,500 in 2020, a reduction of more than 18% compared to 2019. The nationwide lockdown and movement restrictions imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19 may have also contributed to the reduction.

Fatality due to road accidents is highest in India

India ranks first in the number of road accident deaths among 199 countries and accounts for almost 11% of the accident-related deaths in the world, according to the Road Accidents in India 2019 report 2019. Though the number of accidents has reduced in the last 10 years, the number of fatalities has gone up. In 2019, 1.51 lakh persons lost their lives due to road accidents, which is merely 0.2% less than 2018. The fatalities number was about 1.35 lakhs in 2010 and has increased by around 12% between 2010 & 2019.

In 2020, the 26 states/UTs reported a decline in the number of deaths due to road accidents by more than 13,000 or 15%. Over 79,000 deaths were reported in 2020 in these 26 states compared to more than 93,000 deaths in 2019. As noted earlier, this could be because of the nationwide lockdown that restricted the movement of people & vehicles.

However, the possibility of under-reporting in fatalities cannot be ruled out. The data reported by police does not include the deaths that take place in hospitals after 30 days if the hospital data and police data are not linked. Further, fatalities in which the person who caused the accident cannot be identified will not be reported since crime/offence under IPC must be lodged against an individual and not against the road or vehicle or any object.

In 2019, around 4.51 lakh persons were injured in road accidents, the lowest since 2010. The number of persons injured in road accidents has dropped by almost 15% between 2010 & 2019.

90% of Road Accidents were reported by 15 states

A total of 15 states together account for more than 90% of the accidents since 2015. In the last five years, Tamil Nadu topped the list with an average of more than 65,000 accidents reported each year. The state reported more than 70,000 accidents in 2016 which has dropped to over 57,000 in 2019. Tamil Nadu reported close to 45,500 accidents in 2020, the lowest since 2015, yet the highest in India. The majority of the accidents in the state took place on the state and national highways. Tamil Nadu also had the highest number of black spots in the country, which is defined as a 500-meter stretch on the national highways where 5 road accidents or 10 fatalities took place in the last three years. Though Tamil Nadu reported the most accidents, Uttar Pradesh reported the greatest number of fatalities.

Since 2015, among the top 15 states, the states of Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and West Bengal have reported a drop in the number of accidents whereas the states of Bihar, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, and Kerala have reported an increase in the number of road accidents. Seven of these states- Telangana, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, and Gujarat which have reported data for January to December 2020, have reported a drop in accidents even in 2020.

2 out of 3 fatalities in road accidents were due to overspeeding

Over speeding was the reason behind more than 70% of the accidents and 67% of the fatalities, in 2019. Other contributors to the high incidence of road accidents in the country are drunken driving, driving on the wrong side or lane indiscipline, jumping red lights, and usage of phones which are due to poor enforcement of traffic rules.

India ranks 3 globally in terms of total accidents

According to World Road Statistics- 2018 of the International Road Federation, India ranks 3rd in terms of total accidents, among 199 countries. The USA tops the list with more than 31 Lakh accidents. In terms of the incidence of accidents per lakh population, India‚Äôs incidence is 36 per lakh people which is much less than many developed and developing countries like the USA (684), Japan (393), Iran (365) and Turkey (233). However, in terms of fatalities, India tops the list.

Road crash had a severe impact on the vulnerable- poorer households, rural households, and women

A study titled ‚ÄòTraffic Crash Injuries and Disabilities: The Burden on Indian Society‚Äô was conducted by the World Bank to assess the socio-economic impact of road crashes in India across 4 states ‚Äî Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra which accounted for most road accident deaths in the country. It surveyed accident cases and corresponding families of victims to understand the relation between road crash fatalities and poverty, inequality, and vulnerable road users in India. The key findings of the study are as follows-

Fatalities from road crashes are higher among poor families: The risk of a victim undergoing disability after a crash was also 2 times more likely among poor rural households.

The burden of the road crashed is disproportionately borne by poor households: More than 75% of poor households reported a decline in their income because of a road accident, as compared to 54% among high-income households. About 42% of the poor household respondents reported that their household went into debt because of borrowing money after a crash as compared to 11% of respondents from richer households.

Sharp rural-urban divide: The severe impact of the decline in income was highest among poor households in rural areas (56%) compared to those in urban areas (29.5%).

Women have been highly impacted: Women in the families of victims, irrespective of income, often had to take up extra work, assume greater responsibilities, and perform caregiving activities. 50% of women said they were severely affected by the decline in their household income after an accident. While around 11% reported taking up extra work to deal with the financial crisis, 40% of women reported a change in their working patterns post-crash.

Inequality in Insurance coverage and compensation : Insurance coverage was significantly higher among high-income households and households in urban areas as compared to lower-income households in urban areas. About 24% of respondents from high-income households said that they received compensation while, among poorer respondents, only 14% received compensation from insurance companies.

: Insurance coverage was significantly higher among high-income households and households in urban areas as compared to lower-income households in urban areas. About 24% of respondents from high-income households said that they received compensation while, among poorer respondents, only 14% received compensation from insurance companies. Other issues: In addition to financial distress, poor households also experienced a deterioration in their quality of life accompanied by psychological suffering and emotional distress.

Policy-based approaches have been recommended to save lives

The report suggests policy-oriented approaches for saving lives and improving the ability of victims and their families to get back on their feet. Some of the approaches suggested are the following

Inclusion of provision for immediate financial, medical, and legal aid.

Strengthening of health infrastructure and coverage to be made accessible and inclusive.

Post-crash support needs to be strengthened with governments providing a social security net for crash victims from low-income households.

Insurance coverage, especially for poor households must be expanded. An accessible legal framework for availing insurance and compensation for road crash victims should be created.

Considering the gender impact, governments should work on providing special schemes to support women.

602,Gurgaon: Two men fall to death from flyover after their bike crashes,"A college student and his friend, both suspected to be in their early 20s, died as they fell from the elevated road of IFFCO Chowk U-turn flyover after their motorcycle lost balance and crashed into the flyover re-wall on Sunday morning.

Police said the victims were tossed in the air upon impact and fell on the surface road beneath from a height of at least 20 feet.

Police said the deceased have been identified as Saiyad ur Rehman, a college student from Leh, and his friend, Mohammad Zaid, who hailed from Mandikhera in Mewat.

While Rehman was declared dead on arrival, Zaid died during treatment at a private hospital in Sector 38 on Sunday night, said police.

According to police, the incident took place around 11.30 am, when the victims were about to take a U-turn on the IFFCO Chowk flyover towards the Sukhrali side. Police said they were coming from the Delhi side on a Royal Enfield motorcycle.

A police officer said, ‚ÄúIt is suspected that while navigating the U-turn, the motorcycle lost balance and rammed straight into the 2-2.5 feet re-wall. The motorcycle, being heavy, fell near the re-wall, while the occupants were flung from the flyover upon collision.‚Äù

A team from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) reached the spot and inspected the site of the crash.

An NHAI official, requesting anonymity, said, ‚ÄúOne of the victims fell on a car and the other fell straight on the road. Both suffered serious injuries on their head, back and several parts of the body. Several commuters and traffic police rushed them to a private hospital nearby.‚Äù

Police said they had informed the families of the deceased and they are on their way to Gurgaon. The incident led to traffic congestion for over ten minutes at IFFCO Chowk beneath the flyover. Following the incident, a team from Sector 29 police station rushed to the spot.

‚ÄúThe statement of the families of the victims is yet to be recorded. No case has been registered as of now. The sequence of events is not certain and it is unclear what caused the accident. We will check CCTVs in the area during the probe,‚Äù said a police officer, requesting anonymity.

The bodies have been kept in the mortuary for a post-mortem.

In 2019, the NHAI had installed grilles on the elevated U-turn in a bid to reduce the number of accidents.","According to police, the incident took place around 11.30 am, when the victims were about to take a U-turn on the IFFCO Chowk flyover towards the Sukhrali side.

603,Road accidents in India down by 35% this year,"The number of road accidents in the first six months of the year (January to June) were around 1,60,000, 35% less than the average number of accidents reported in the corresponding period in the previous six years, an obvious result of a nationwide lockdown imposed in March to slow the spread of the Covid-19 infection. The number of people who died also dropped by 30% this year.

The information on the accidents was provided by the government in Parliament on Thursday.

On an average, nearly 2,48,000 road accidents were reported between January and June each year between 2014 and 2019. The month-wise breakup of accidents for the previous years is from annual reports on road accidents published by the ministry of road transport and highways, and annual reports on accidental deaths and suicides published by the ministry of home affairs. (See chart 1)

There was a drop in the number of road accidents between 2019 and 2020 in all states and union territories except three small northeastern states ‚Äì Meghalaya, Sikkim and Nagaland. Among big states, the largest percentage drop in the number of road accidents was seen in Karnataka (48%). Delhi reported a 46% drop in accidents this year. (See chart 2)

The 68-day long nationwide lockdown imposed in the last week of March, reduced traffic and mobility in the months of April and May. Even in June, many parts of the country were under localised lockdowns, and many business, merchant and recreational establishments continued to be closed. The number of accidents from April to June this year (50,336) was 55% less than the corresponding number last year (1,12,215).

In terms of fatalities in road accidents, 56,288 people died in the first six months of this year compared to 79,678 in the same period last year, a drop of about 30%.

In the April to June period, the number of fatalities in road accidents dropped by nearly 51% compared to the same period in 2019, which is about 20,000 less fatalities.","On an average, nearly 2,48,000 road accidents were reported between January and June each year between 2014 and 2019.

604,Bihar first state to simplify road accident claims,"Bihar will be the first state to simplify claims of road traffic accident (RTA) by removing the victim or their dependents from the litigation process and paying them an interim ex-gratia amount of ‚Çπ5 lakh within 15 days in event of death, officials driving the change have said.

The state will also take the onus to contest the case in court, on behalf of the victim, if the insurance firm of the accused vehicle owner, decides to challenge the order.

Come September 15, and the state will implement the new amendment to the Bihar Motor Vehicle Rules that empowers the state transport appellate tribunal to settle all such accident claims within 60 days. The new amendment was notified in the Bihar gazette on August 11 after a cabinet order.

So far, road traffic accident claims are tried in the civil court and linger for years.

‚ÄúThis is the first of its kind initiative in India to simplify accident claims,‚Äù said Bihar‚Äôs transport secretary, Sanjay Kumar Agarwal.

The new rules allow immediate payment of ‚Çπ5 lakh as interim compensation for death and ‚Çπ50,000 for grievous injury to dependents or victims of road traffic accidents, involving vehicles that are insured, uninsured or involved in hit-and-run case. The compensation for grievous injury is proposed to be increased from ‚Çπ50,000 to ‚Çπ2.5 lakh.

As part of the new rules, victims or their relatives will not have to run from pillar to post for settlement of claim. The state will pay the interim compensation and also take the responsibility of fighting a legal suit on behalf of the victim if an insurance firm were to challenge its order.

‚ÄúWe have set up a revolving corpus of ‚Çπ50 crore under the Bihar motor vehicle accident assistance fund through which such payments will be made,‚Äù said Agarwal.

In case of insured vehicles, the state will pay the compensation to the victim or their dependents through the corpus fund and recover the amount from the insurance firm after the tribunal settles the case within the stipulated 60 days, he added.

For uninsured vehicles, the state will recover the compensation amount by auctioning the vehicle if its vehicle owner is unable to pay the compensation to the victim‚Äôs family. Should the amount realised through auction be less than the compensation fixed, the state will bear the difference amount through the Bihar motor vehicle accident assistance fund, said Agarwal.

Nearly 20% of the 13.60 lakh registered vehicles in the state till 2019-20 do not renew their insurance. ‚ÄúWe will start a special drive to check for insurance of motor vehicles soon,‚Äù he added.

For hit-and-run case, the compensation amount will be borne through the corpus fund and replenished partially by the Centre through insurance companies, which pay ‚Çπ50,000. The state will bear the remaining ‚Çπ4,50,000 in deaths involving hit-and-run cases.

Under the changed rules, all sub-divisional officers (SDO) will be the accident claim inquiry officer and district magistrates (DM) the accident claims assessment officer. The SDO conducts the inquiry on the basis of site inspection done by the police and the motor vehicle inspector.

‚ÄúThe changed rules do not mandate any site inspection or examination of witness at the trial stage. If challenged, the case will be adjudicated on the basis of a summary trial based on the petition of the victim or their relatives, deposition by the insurance firm and reports by the police, the SDO and DM,‚Äù said Agarwal.

In case the tribunal or a higher court awards a higher compensation, the difference of the amount already paid as interim compensation would be credited into the bank account of the victim‚Äôs family. However, in case of an adverse order for the government, the interim amount already paid as compensation to the family of the victim will not be taken back but adjusted through the Bihar motor vehicle accident assistance fund.

Bihar ranks 15th in India in terms of road accidents and ninth in terms of fatalities arising out of them, as per the latest data released by the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRT&H) in 2019.

Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat are among states which rank higher than Bihar both in terms of number of road accidents and deaths.

Bihar had only 9.3 recorded cases of road accidents against the national average of 34.2 per lakh population in 2019.

With a score of 11.7, it ranked 22nd in terms of accidents per 10,000 vehicles.","Come September 15, and the state will implement the new amendment to the Bihar Motor Vehicle Rules that empowers the state transport appellate tribunal to settle all such accident claims within 60 days.

In total, 7,659 cases of injuries to persons were reported in 2020 as compared to 9,362 in 2019.According to Manoj Yadav , director general of police (DGP), informed that dip in road mishaps and casualties is a result of better traffic management, enhanced safety measures, improved enforcement of traffic regulations together with continuous awareness drive about road and traffic safety. However, the lockdown enforced to contain the spread of Covid-19 also contributed to a significant dip in the accidents.Giving highest priority to saving the lives of people, he said that police have provided 84 ambulances, 40 big cranes and 22 small/medium cranes in all districts for immediate first-aid to the accident victims and removal of such vehicles. In addition, 45 traffic assistance booths have also been set up every 10-km along national highways to provide help to the accident victims.""We are also working on a series of remedial measures like identifying black spots and getting them rectified on priority, improving the conditions of roads and putting up signages.

606,Road Accidents in India - Goa Chronicle,"According to a report by World Bank, India has a mere 1% of the world‚Äôs vehicles but accounts for 11% of the global deaths due to road accidents, which is highest in the world! Undoubtedly, road accidents in India are a much more inimical enemy than the deadly virus.

Every year, India witnesses more than 4.5 lakh road crashes, in which 1.5 lakh people die. As per the World Bank report there happen 53 road crashes every hour in India, taking a toll on 1 person‚Äôs life every 4 minutes! All through the last decade, 50 lakh Indians got injured in road accidents while a whopping 13 lakh lost their lives.

According to a recent study commissioned by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), the socio- economic costs of road crashes at Rs. 1, 47, 114 crore in India, which is equivalent to 0.77% of the country‚Äôs GDP.As per the ministry, 76.2% of the people who lose their lives in road crashes are in their prime working age that is 18- 45 years.

All through 2019, a total of 1, 51, 113 people were killed in 4, 80, 652 road accidents, an average of 414 deaths a day or 17 deaths per hour. In 2019, India continued to account for the largest number of road fatalities in the world, followed by China with 63, 093 deaths in 2, 12, 846 accidents. While the USA recorded the highest number of road crashes- 22, 11, 439 in which 37, 461 deaths were reported in the same year.

While the leading cause of road crashes and deaths was found out to be speeding, two- wheelers were involved in most of the fatalities. The highest number of road accidents was witnessed by Tamil Nadu (57, 228), followed by Madhya Pradesh (50, 669), Uttar Pradesh (42, 572), Kerala (41, 111) and Karnataka (40, 658).

As far as road fatalities among cities was concerned, Delhi retained its first rank in 2019 with 1, 463 deaths, followed by Jaipur (1, 283 deaths), Chennai (1, 252 deaths) and Bengaluru (768 deaths).

According to the World Bank, the road crash fatality rate is three- times higher in low-income countries compared to high income countries. The report stated, ‚ÄúThere is a distinct correlation between socio- economic status and road use patterns in low and middle income countries and poor people are more likely to be involved in a road traffic crash.‚Äù

In a country like India, the income level of an individual directly determines the mode of transport used by the person; and vulnerable road users are forced to share space with other less vulnerable users. This therefore increases the amount of risk faced by a particular road user. The World Bank report also stated that daily wage workers and casual labourers are more prone to be defined as vulnerable as compared to individuals engaged in regular activities.

Thus, the vulnerable road users constitute of poor male users coming from the working age category and these users account for more than half of all the road crash fatalities and injuries in India.

It is the ultimate fact of the matter that majority of these accidents are caused by human negligence and a callous attitude while on the roads. All through our childhood, teachers have taught us to follow the traffic rules and be a responsible citizen and an alert driver, alas, we tend to forget the values and rules as we grow up and that results into Indians turning into irresponsible citizens with a dearth of civic sense. Now this doesn‚Äôt mean that only the drivers ought to be responsible, many a time, the drivers follow the traffic rules, it is the pedestrian who is at fault; therefore, as Indians we literally need to learn to walk while on the roads too!

Nevertheless, one of the major causes which lead to road crashes is distracted driving. Driving needs undivided attention; READING OR REPLYING TO TEXTS, ATTENDING CALLS, LISTENING TO SONGS CAN WAIT! What good will these things do if you lose your life?

Another dangerous cause of the same is driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. DO NOT DRINK AND DRIVE! Kindly take a cab home if you‚Äôve had a drink or let your sober friend drive. Don‚Äôt think that you won‚Äôt be intoxicated after partying the whole night! On another note, TRY QUITTING ALCOHOL AND DRUGS! They are anyhow perilous to your health and life!

Most of the accidents on road occur due to speeding. Reckless driving leads to the most horrible of crashes, DO NOT THINK YOU LOOK ‚ÄòCOOL‚Äô WHILE YOU HIT THE THROTTLE OR PUSH THE ACCELERATOR FURTHER. The speed might thrill you but it can anytime kill you! Also important is time management- try to be on time. Mostly, people need to rush to offices or any other location where they are expected to be because they‚Äôre running late. Try to reach places on time; you won‚Äôt be needed to turn into a formula 1 racer then!

There are two things of utmost importance whose very existence is ignored by Indians on road- your helmet or seat belt! Kindly wear your helmet if on a two- wheeler; your hairstyle won‚Äôt save your life, your helmet will. Similarly, why can‚Äôt we wear a seat belt while driving a car? Not only it keeps our body posture straight but also prevents the chances of fatalities in case of a head to head collision. HOW DO YOU THINK IT‚ÄôLL FEEL WITH THE STEERING WHEEL BREAKING INTO YOUR RIBCAGE? Definitely not a pretty sight to imagine or a sensation worth enjoying!

Lastly, traffic rules are meant to follow and not only be studied during school! A single and simple broken rule can lead to massive havoc, KINDLY KEEP ALL YOUR EXCUSES ASIDE AND FOLLOW THE RULES, the reason to rush can wait but your life won‚Äôt wait before it bids goodbye!

#RoadAccidents, #RoadAccidentsInIndia, #TrafficRules, #RoadCrashesInIndia #RoadFatalitiesInIndia","Undoubtedly, road accidents in India are a much more inimical enemy than the deadly virus.
Every year, India witnesses more than 4.5 lakh road crashes, in which 1.5 lakh people die.
All through the last decade, 50 lakh Indians got injured in road accidents while a whopping 13 lakh lost their lives.
According to a recent study commissioned by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), the socio- economic costs of road crashes at Rs.
In 2019, India continued to account for the largest number of road fatalities in the world, followed by China with 63, 093 deaths in 2, 12, 846 accidents.",news.google.com/./articles/CAIiEG3aY0cvUjCb2_trWzAYsfMqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowoL2ICzDdmIcDMIGloQY?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen
607,"Work In Progress: Gadkari Aims To Reduce Road Accidents, Fatalities By 2030","Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari stated that his ministry has pledged to reduce road accidents and resultant deaths in India by at least 50% before 2025. Gadkari was speaking after launching a webinar series on Wednesday, where he also praised Tamil Nadu for having achieved this goal already.

The webinar series that Gadkari inaugurated was at an International Virtual Symposium on Vehicle Crash Safety organised by MIT Art, Design and Technology University.

According to Gadkari, his ministry aims to provide safer roads by constructing highways with 4-16 lanes. They are also prodding automobile manufacturers to implement newer technologies for safety.

Vision To Eliminate Road Fatalities

The minister said, ""The target is to reduce road accidents by 50 per cent before 2025, and we can achieve zero deaths due to road accidents by 2030,"" as reported by Firstpost.

The minister said they wanted to work on the vision to eliminate all road accident deaths by 2030. He also gave the example of the success of Tamil Nadu, which has reduced road fatalities and accidents by a whopping 53%.

But how are the other states performing in terms of road accidents?

States With Highest Rates Of Accidents

According to a report released by Statista, the highest number of road accidents in 2019 were recorded in Tamil Nadu, with over 57,000 reported road accidents. It was followed by Madhya Pradesh, with over 51,000 reported cases. Notably, most of these accidents were caused by over-speeding.

When it comes to deaths due to road accidents, the situation is no better. The last state-wise data about road fatalities was released by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in 2018.

The state with the highest number of deaths per year was Uttar Pradesh (with 25,000 deaths), followed by Andhra Pradesh (16,000), Tamil Nadu (15,000), Maharashtra (13,000), and Karnataka (9,500). The number of daily deaths in these states ranged between 26-70, and the interval between two consecutive road fatalities in each state ranged between 20-90 minutes.

With so many road accidents and fatalities taking place daily, an obvious question that comes to mind is, how does India stand in terms of accidents globally?

India: Country With Highest Number Of Road Accidents

In a Press Information Bureau (PIB) release published on February 9, Gadkari said India ranks one in road accidents globally, ahead of the US and China. Over 4.5 lakh people get injured in road accidents yearly, and around 1.5 lakh die. The average number of deaths per day stands at 415, and 70% of these deaths are in the age group 18-45 years. What's most alarming, the socio-economic loss from these accidents is 3.14% of national GDP.

Coordination Is Key

The recent developments in Tamil Nadu suggest that some things might have started to change for the better. Perhaps the Gadkari ministry understood it well that for a comprehensive solution, the ministry must work in tandem with other related units. As reported by the PIB release, Gadkari had said that improvement in education, enforcement, engineering, and emergency care services are a few steps towards tackling the problem.

The minister had also mentioned that the ministry had been correcting over 5,000 accident blackspots identified on the highway network. At the time, more than 40,000 km of roadway was being audited for safety. He further noted that the central government had proposed a state support programme that would incentivise the states to improve road safety, with a fund of Rs. 14,000 crores.

However, he also remarked that road safety ‚Äî on a larger perspective ‚Äî road safety is a ""behavioural issue"" and hence need cooperative federalism to encourage coordination, starting from the block to the taluka level.

609,India recorded highest number of road accident deaths across the globe in 2019 as well,"India recorded highest number of road accident deaths across the globe in 2019 as well

Key Highlights A total of 449,002 accidents occurred in India in 2019 151,113 people were killed and 451,361 were injured due to road accidents last year National Highways accounted for an inordinate share of deaths yet again

Another year, another 'Road Accidents in India' report by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. If we had to sum it all up in one line, we would say 'It is still not looking good'. Sure enough, the total number of road accidents in India declined 3.86 per cent in 2019, but we still ranked first in the world for the total number of road accident deaths. India, in fact, accounted for roughly 11 per cent of the total accident related deaths in the world. A total 449,002 accidents occurred in India in 2019, causing 151,113 deaths and 451,361 injuries.

Yet another worrying trend that reared its head again in the Road Accidents in India in 2019 report had to do with National Highways, account for 2.03 percent of the total road network in the country. The report notes that National Highways accounted for an inordinate share of 35.7 per cent of deaths last year. This is not news though, i.e. the national highways in India have always been one a sore spot, with a disproportiante share in the total number of road accident deaths in the country.

Clearly, we need to do better when it comes to road safety on National Highways. Besides that, state highways, which account for 3.01 per cent of India's road length, accounted for 24.8 per cent road accident deaths, followed by other roads contributing the remaining 39 per cent.

If you thought that was bad enough, here's a look at another statistic that should scare everyone: Over-speeding contributed 67.3 per cent of the total road accident deaths in India last year, followed by driving on the wrong side of the road and drink driving, accounting for 6 per cent and 3.5 per cent of accident deaths, respectively.

What is even more concerning is the fact that road accidents, deaths, and persons killed owing to over-speeding, drink driving, and driving on the wrong side -- all of them recorded growth as compared to figures from 2018. And people thought the Motor Vehicle Act 2019 is ""excessive"". Clearly, neither is it execessive nor is its enforcement robust enough. Not yet, at least.","India recorded highest number of road accident deaths across the globe in 2019 as wellKey Highlights A total of 449,002 accidents occurred in India in 2019 151,113 people were killed and 451,361 were injured due to road accidents last year National Highways accounted for an inordinate share of deaths yet againAnother year, another 'Road Accidents in India' report by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.

According to the statistics of the state police, 4738 persons were killed in road mishaps in the state last year as against 5333 deaths in 2019.The government, however, is still concerned despite a fall in the death rate. ‚ÄúWe had expected that the accident deaths would come down by at least 40% because of the Covid-induced lockdown last year.

611,"Poor enforcement, training: The reasons why there are so many road accidents in India","Road accidents cost India 3-5% of gross domestic product every year, and are avoidable if India could improve its roads and city planning, train its drivers better, and enforce traffic laws properly, an Indiaspend analysis shows.

India‚Äôs young, productive population, aged 18-45 years, is involved in 70% of road accidents, according to data from Road Accidents in India 2018, a report published by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.

Over a period of 24 years from 2014 to 2038, if India could halve the deaths and injuries due to road traffic, its GDP could increase by 7%, a 2018 World Bank report said.

In 2018, India had 467,044 reported road accidents, an increase of 0.5% from 464,910 in 2017, according to the road ministry‚Äôs data.

India has 1% of the world‚Äôs vehicles but accounts for 6% of the world‚Äôs road traffic accidents, according to data from a 2018 World Health Organization report. As many as 73% of all deaths due to road traffic accidents in 2018 in the South and South-East Asia region happened in India, the report said.

Road accidents are one of the 12 most common causes of deaths in India, the ninth most common cause of premature deaths, and the 10th most common reason for disability, according to the 2017 WHO Global Health Estimates.

In 2018, of all road deaths, the most were of those riding two-wheelers (36%), followed by pedestrians (15%), ministry data shows.

Speeding and drink driving

The two most frequent causes of road deaths are speeding and drunk driving, followed by a lack of lane discipline (driving on the wrong side), jumping the red light and the use of a mobile phone while driving, data shows.

Overspeeding is the most common cause of deaths on roads in India, with 64% of road deaths because of speeding. Sixty per cent of the accidents in India occur on highways, mostly because of speeding, said Piyush Tewari from Save a Life Foundation.

The most deaths due to speeding were in Rajasthan (9,618 deaths), followed by Tamil Nadu (9,224 deaths) and Karnataka (8,714 deaths).

The fine for speeding has increased from Rs 500 to Rs 5,000 since September, 2019 under the new Motor Vehicles Act of 2019. In addition, drivers could also be imprisoned for three months for speed racing ‚Äì an illegal race ‚Äì if it is their first offence, and for a period of one year if it is the second offence, according to the law.

The current speed limit in the country is 80 km per hour on a 4-lane highway. However, the WHO has recommended that if we reduce the speed limit to about 55-57 km per hour, we could save around 30%-37% lives, said Patanjali Nayyar, regional advisor for the WHO.

Accidents due to drunk driving ‚Äì under the influence of alcohol or drugs ‚Äì declined by 14% between 2017 and 2018 because of an increase in fines and better implementation of laws, mostly in metro cities, and because of greater media coverage of the issue, according to experts.

The new motor vehicles law increased punishment for the first offence to imprisonment up to six months and/or fine up to Rs 10,000, and for the second offence to two years and/or fine of Rs 15,000. Earlier, the fine was Rs 2,000 or six months for the first offence and Rs 3,000 or two years imprisonment, according to the Motor Vehicles Act 1989.

Poor enforcement

India‚Äôs traffic laws are stricter than those of other countries but these laws are not enforced.

In many other countries, such as the UK, Australia, New Zealand, where they have better enforcement, the alcohol is limit is 0.08 mg/l, higher than the 0.05 mg/l in India, said Nayyar of the WHO. ‚ÄúIn many countries crashes due to alcohol have been reduced due to enforcement of their laws and education.‚Äù

India‚Äôs enforcement of laws on speeding and drunk driving are rated 3 and 4 out of 10, respectively, compared to 8 and 9 in China and 9 (for both) in Sri Lanka, by the Global Road Safety Report 2018, that analysed traffic laws of 175 countries.

India has a paucity of traffic police ‚Äì 30% of 85,144 traffic policemen positions and 39% of 58,509 sanctioned traffic constable positions were vacant in 2018, according to data from the Bureau of Police Research and Development.

Enforcement of laws can reduce drunk driving, said Tewari of Save a Life Foundation, and gave the example of Satyendra Garg, who was the joint commissioner of traffic in New Delhi in 2012 and would conduct random ‚Äúanti-drink and drive drives‚Äù almost every day. Because of the fear of these checks, people stopped drinking and driving, Tewari said. Over 12,000 people were prosecuted for drunk driving in New Delhi in 2011, up from 8,648 in 2010, according to data from the International Road Federation, a global non-profit working on road safety.

‚ÄúWhen it comes to enforcement we know human behaviour is affected by enforcement and in India, enforcement is largely driven by human beings and is prone to corruption,‚Äù said Tewari. He suggests using artificial intelligence, in the form of road sensors to detect speed, and adaptive traffic lighting (in which traffic signal timing changes, or adapts, based on actual traffic demand) for enforcing traffic laws, such as in Sri Lanka and Bhutan.

City planning

On many roads there are no traffic-calming measures such as speed humps before intersections or median barriers, Tewari said.

Roads should be made not just for use by four-wheelers but also for two-wheelers and pedestrians, and towns should be planned not just for expressways and commercial areas but also for hawkers and vendors, Nayyar said. For instance, safer highways should be created by adding underpasses for pedestrians, especially those that are vulnerable, such as pregnant women and the elderly.

Nayyar gave the example of the Delhi-Agra highway where the highway has divided villages, but there are no pedestrian crossings. ‚ÄúHow do we expect people whose village has been divided by that highway to crossover to their fields everyday? There are some villages on this stretch of the highway that are villages of widows due to the deaths caused by road accidents,‚Äù Nayyar said.

Driver training

In 2018, in 26% of all road accidents, drivers who were in an accident did not have a valid license or were driving with a learner‚Äôs license, ministry data shows.

In any case, licences are not a sign that the driver is qualified, experts said.

For example, if we go out and ask drivers about the three-second rule (which ensures driving at a safe speed, and the distance between two vehicles) or whether they are aware of a blindspot in their vehicle while driving, 99% will not know because they have not received any sort of formal training, said Tewari.

‚ÄúBasically we made a road and allowed untrained drivers...Drivers need hard skills training on driving, not just ads and awareness,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe have announced that we will reduce traffic deaths by 50%. This is a joke unless and until we combine efforts in the four E‚Äôs: engineering, enforcement, education, and emergency response,‚Äù Tewari said.

Data management systems

India had about 300,000 road deaths in 2016, almost double the government estimate of 151,000 deaths, according to the 2018 Global Road Safety report of the WHO, highlighting the lack of quality road accident data.

‚ÄúThe data is deeply fractured‚Ä¶ The biggest challenge in data collection in road accidents is the crash investigation report. When a crash occurs very little is done to determine the cause of the crash. Attempt is made to fix the responsibility on the driver of the bigger car,‚Äù said Piyush Tewari.

For instance, in states where alcohol is banned, such as Bihar, Nagaland and Gujarat, there has been a decline in accidents due to drunk driving, data shows.

‚ÄúMy sense is that the more you ban something, the more people are likely to do it,‚Äù Tewari said. But not all states have a good data management system, so they might be under-reporting accidents or not managing the data well, he explained.

‚ÄúThe state of Kerala has banned alcohol, but it also has a very good data recording system,‚Äù Tewari said. In Kerala, drunk driving accidents increased from 35 in 2014 to 133 in 2017. Alcohol was banned in the state between 2014 and 2017.

Goa, with the highest per capita availability of alcohol, had no road deaths due to drunk driving in 2016, which is likely to be because of an error in collecting information on accidents, Tewari said. In 2018, Goa reported nine accidents due to drunk driving and four deaths.

Often, traffic police do not have the necessary equipment to determine the cause of an accident. For instance, most police report a case of drunk driving only through smelling, since most of them do not have a breathalyzer, especially in smaller cities, said Patanjali Dev Nayyar, the regional advisor for disability, injury prevention and rehabilitation at WHO.

‚ÄúIf the police arrive late at the scene of the accident, it is difficult to determine whether alcohol was involved,‚Äù Daniel Keniston, an assistant professor at Yale University, told IndiaSpend in July 2017.

612,"Punjab lost Rs 15000 crore ‚Äî 3% of its GDP ‚Äî due to road accidents between 2016-19, says road research organisation data","Around 3.3 to 3.5 per cent of all deaths due to road accidents in the country every year between 2016 and 2019 were reported from Punjab. Of these, around 65 per cent of Punjab‚Äôs road fatalities were reported from National and State Highways ‚Äî both of which make up around 5.64 per cent of the total road length in Punjab. The total monetary loss for Punjab in terms of these road accidents added up to around Rs.15,000 crore ‚Äî which roughly works out to 3 per cent of Punjab‚Äôs GDP (Rs 5.29 lakh crores). The annual loss on National Highways due to these accidents was calculated at around Rs 5,600 crore, whereas the annual loss on state highways worked up to around Rs 4333 crore.

These hard-hitting figures were shared by Dr Navdeep Asija, the Programme Director of Sector 38-based Institute for Development and Communication, Chandigarh, during the roundtable conference on Road Safety and Socio-Economic Assessment of National Highway in Punjab, on Thursday, that was held in association with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and Punjab police.

Asija, during Thursday‚Äôs conference, further stated that the comparative data showed that the death rate per kilometre on National Highways in Punjab was 0.5, which was less than many other states ‚Äî including Chandigarh and Haryana.

Dr Shuchi Kapuria of the Institute for Development and Communication said that highways have improved accessibility to agriculture markets, health and educational facilities, created new employment opportunities, reduced travel times and facilitated travel. But they have also contributed to an increase in heinous crimes, water and air pollution and triggered an increase in land prices. The districts of Fatehgarh Sahib and Kapurthala registered the most number of road accident cases in Punjab during the assessment years, it was mentioned.

Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta, on his part, emphasised that traffic was an important part of police duty as it is an issue that touches the lives of every individual. ‚ÄúRegulating it can not only save lives and time but can also help in reducing avoidable tragedies that cause the death of our loved ones. There is a need to curb traffic violations on one hand and generate public awareness on the other,‚Äù Gupta said.

Dr. Sharad Satya Chauhan, ADGP (Traffic) Punjab, echoed Gupta‚Äôs views and added, ‚ÄúWe should think out of the box. The key lies in innovative resolution and implementation of rules, but it should be accompanied by evaluation, education, emergency response, engineering, and most importantly, empathy,‚Äù RP Singh the regional officer for NHAI mentioned that there was a need to quantify the advantage highway development has on income, assets formation, access to health and higher education. He appreciated that the study conducted by IDC in association with the NHAI and Punjab Police was focusing on this aspect.

‚ÄúThe changes in the mobility patterns do make an impact on people‚Äôs livelihood, access to social development, increased social risks, production and consumption patterns and supply chain. This may also increase development activities like industrialisation, tourism which may have a serious influence on people‚Äôs social lives, water quality and its availability, air quality, consumption patterns, and even music and culture,‚Äù said. Anirudh Tewari, additional Chief Secretary-cum-Financial Commissioner (Development) of Punjab. He suggested that there is a need to evolve measurable indicators of social change due to highways and transportation to formulate sustainable, equitable, and distributive justice-oriented social change.
