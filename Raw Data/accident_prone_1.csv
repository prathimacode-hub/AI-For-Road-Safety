HYDERABAD: The three-kilometre-long stretch from Nagarjuna Circle to KBR Park will now have railings on the divider to prevent residents from jaywalking.

In the tragic accident that took place on Monday where two men were knocked down by a Porsche Cayenne being driven by a man in an inebriated condition when the duo was crossing the road. Meanwhile, the two accused in the case were remanded to 14-day judicial custody.

Hyderabad Traffic Police are making plans in coordination with the GHMC to prevent such incidents in the future. The police observed that jaywalking is common in the stretch and such accidents could repeat themselves in the future.

Designated spaces will be marked at short distances where there is a possibility of people crossing the road and they will be marked for people to cross easily and also for motorists to slow down and drive more carefully at these places.","Pinto Deepak ByExpress News ServiceHYDERABAD: The three-kilometre-long stretch from Nagarjuna Circle to KBR Park will now have railings on the divider to prevent residents from jaywalking.
